1   provided insulation against the colder air of    
    the mountains.
2   to keep himself warm becose it's cold up there.  
3   This will trap a layer of warm air next to the   
    goats skin, helping to keep it warm in low
    temperatures that can occur in high mountains
4   To keep it warm in the cold high altitudes by    
    insulating a layer of warm air around it
5   So the animal doesn't get cold.                  
6   keeps it warm                                    
7   was too keep it warm because its cold at the top 
    of mountains.
8   allowed the goat survived in cold weather        
9   To keep itself warm. Mountains at a high         
    altitude are cold
10  keep warm from could atmosphere                  
11  to insulate the animal and keep it warm in the   
    cold mountain climate
12  keep warm.                                       
13  Insulation from the cold mountain air, as thick  
    fur means more air spaces for warm air to
    circulate
14  traps a layer of air around the bucardo's body,  
    which is warmed by its blood, providing
    insulation from the cold
15  kept it warm whilst on the mountain              
16  Insulated the goat against cold up in mountains  
    and fur traps heat so stays warmer.
17  prevents loss of heat energy                     
18  Acts as insulation against the skin so the       
    bucardo does not lose body heat and keeps warm
19  Help to insulate the bucardo, as conditions can  
    be cold and inhospitable high in the mountains.
20  its colder higher you are in the moutains        
    (really cold)
21  keep the bucardo warm high up in the mountains   
22  this insulates the bucardo from cold weather     
    outside.
23  insulates it. Traps air to reduce heat loss from 
    animal as it is very cold in mountains.
24  This insulated him from the cold as the          
    mountains were high the temperatures would be
    low
25  provides good insulation                         
26  this fur traps a layer of air against the body   
    that is warmed by body heat and remains there to
    warm the goat as air is a poor conductor of heat
27  prevent heat loss                                
28  to keep the bucardo warm (trap the heat)         
29  insulates the body. Keeps it warm.               
30  to keep it warm during the winter                
31  So that it keept the goat warm.                  
32  high in the mountains, its colder Fur - Kept the 
    goat warm.
33  to be able to stand cold temperatures up high    
34  insulated the goat from the cool temperatures    
    high in the mountains.
35  helps to keep the bucardo warm - prevents heat   
    loss.
36  Keep warmth in and protected the skin from being 
    damaged (as much).
37  kept the bucardo's warm up in the mountains      
38  keeps the bucardos body warm - less heat is lost 
    the more fur their is
39  traps air and insulates the bucardo              
40  protection from the wind

43  to keep them warm                                
44  It is cold in the mountains, so the thick fur    
    insulates the goat and keeps it warm,
    maintaining a good body temperature.
45  insulates the bucardo from the low temperatures  
46  Gives them body insulation, keeping them warm.   
47  keeps the goat warm in cold conditions           
48  helped it keep warm                              
49  so that it could store water, and not lose alot  
    through evaporation.
50  would give it good insulation against cold       
    weather
51  In high altitude it is cold. Thick fur acts as   
    insulation.
52  helps keep him warm and can also help to         
    camaflage him if necessary.
53  To protect the bucardo from cold weather.        
54  helps the bucardo survive cold weather high in   
    the mountains.

66  provides it with insulation for warmth in the    
    high mountains, where it is cold.
67  keep it warm as it is cold in the mountains.     
68  mountains are cold so the fur keeps it warm by   
    insulating heat - maintaining body temperature.
69  High mountains tends to be cold, thick fur for   
    insulation
70  for warmth                                       
71  The thick fur would capture air between it which 
    would act as insulation, keeping it warm.
72  This allows the bucardo to keep warm in the      
    winter as the fur is insulating. Also, it allows
    the bucardo to store fat, which it can use for
    energy if there's a food shortage.
73  Traps lots of air between the hairs which its    
    body can heat up so insulating itself from the
    cold.
74  This insulated the deer keeping it warm.         
75  keeps heat inside the body, it acts as an        
    insulator

1   to grip easly of mountain slopes.                
2   Allows it to grip onto rocks and gaps in the     
    rocks when moving around the mountains so it
    does not fall and it can go where it wants in
    order to catch food etc.
3   fought off any predators and used them to kill   
    its prey.
4   To help the bucardo climb the mountains.         
5   help bucardo to climb rocks because they can     
    cling them or pierce them
6   so that it can climb mountains and grip onto     
    unsteady ground, i.e loose rock.
7   make it easier for it to climb up high and would 
    have good grip.
8   for grip on the hard rock and to run quickly     
    from predators.
9   It can climb more easily steep mountains and     
    awkward climbs.
10  As mountains are rocky, sharp curved hooves help 
    Bucardo to grip and climb
11  able to walk on narrow edges                     
12  to help kill preadtor and so they can hang on to

1   It means that 'man' cannot harm the goat in any  
    way or 'he' could be prosicuted. It is designed
    to make the animal's numbers increase as it
    could only be killed by natural curcumstances.
2   They help to survive because we are protecting   
    it so that they nobody can kill them for fur or
    for meat.
3   Protecting' a species means increasing its       
    population size by making it illegal to hunt the
    species or greatly limiting this activity. This
    could also be done by preserving its natural
    habitat by limiting activities such as
    deforestation having a species in captivity and
    releasing it into the wild would also help
    increase numbers.
4   It is then illegal to shoot, harm or kill the    
    animal because of the 'protected species' law
5   Labelling a type of animal 'a protected species' 
    limits the number of people hunting the
    creature, as this would become illegal.
    Sanctuaries may also be started this is when
    'protected species' are bread out of captivity.
6   When an animal becomes 'a protected species' it  
    is given more of a chance to survive by not
    exposing it to its natural predators, increasing
    numbers of its natural prey, a tabbing system on
    the numbers to they can be monitered It has more
    of a chance to survive.
7   Making an animal 'a protected species' helps it  
    survive, as it is safe from predators and does
    not have to compete for food. Allowing them to
    live to reproduce.
8   It stops people killing the species, and         
    encourages steps to be taken to ensure its
    survival. For instance, to not disturb it's
    habitat.
9   If an animal becomes 'protected' it means no one 
    can kill or harm it. This means that the species
    has a chance to replenish and reproduce whilst
    they are protected so the population increases.
10  by making an animal a proteced speciase makes it 
    illegal to hunt and kill .: allowing more them
    to bread succesfully.
11  Laws are enforced that make it illegal to hunt   
    or kill the animal that is now a 'protected
    species', and the penalty for breaking the law
    deters people. Also, it brings the threat to the
    animal to the publics attention.
12  Increases knowledge of it's own danger to other  
    people. May encourage them to make preventative
    actions towards it's extinction in the hope of
    avoiding trouble for them-selves if they harm it
    in any way.
13  By making a type of animal 'a protected          
    species', the animal is protected from harm from
    humans and other animals,
14  When an animal is declared a 'protected species' 
    it helps it to survive because more people are
    made aware of it. It also helps as extra care is
    then taken to protect it.
15  The species would be protected against being     
    hunted by man, there would be a punishment (eg a
    fine) for anyone that hunted and killed them it
    enables them to live in their natural habitat on
    their own without the threat of being killed.
    Man is not their natural predator.
16  The animals increased protection improves its    
    standard of living. In effect are animals live
    longer, and produce more animals that have the
    same protection
17  If it is living in a certain area where man      
    wants to build on, it cannot as it is now a
    'protected specie'
18  it allows the species to procreate without the   
    threat of being hunted for food or clothing by
    human beings
19  Less people will try to kill the species so it   
    we produce more and more babys each year
20  It makes people aware of a dying species and     
    also makes it illegal to hunt or kill one of
    these animals.
21  By protecting a species the animal will stay     
    alive, because man is not allowed to hunt and
    they are prevented from danger.
22  If an animal is a ''protected species'' then it  
    makes it illegal for the humans to damage or
    kill the animal. It is therefore protected and
    left in their natural envirnoment to encourage
    maximum breeding.
23  It is not hunted for a part of it (fur, horns)   
    so is left to increase its population.
24  because they are not aloud to be harmed by man!  
    There are people looking after them to help them
    survive.
25  this means that it cannot be harmed by man and   
    will get help from places / people like RSPCA.
26  Making an animal a protected species would stop  
    hunters from killing them and it would stop
    people from disterbing the animal natural
    habbitat.
27  Making a animal "a protected species" will help  
    it to survive because it stops hunters from
    hunting the animal so the species numbers will
    increase.
28  Making an animal a 'protected species' helps it  
    to survive as it reduces the factors that could
    affect them. For instance it protects the
    species from human damage and other predators.
29  So less people try to hunt for them so they have 
    more chance at reproducing more of the species.
30  It means it is illegal to kill, harm or capture  
    an animal so people leave them alone, so there
    numbers can increase again.
31  By making animals a 'protected species' this     
    increases the liklehood of it surviving as for
    example hunters are not allowed to hunt it, the
    animals are possibly mated under special
    conditions to ensure they produce much off
    spring. The animals could be kept in special
    conditions to ensure it has the required amount
    of food, + mates and it could be separated from
    its predators.
32  This is because it decreases the chance of       
    hunters trying to hunt & kill it. They can be
    looked after resulting in less chance of
    disease. Also, so they can be breeded.
33  This helps the animal to survive because if it   
    is protectful of their species then this animal
    would protect their familys and themselves.
34  If an animal is a protected species then every   
    animal in the species is monitored and it's
    health is constantly checked, meaning if a
    disease occurs or a member of the protected
    species is ill then they can be treated more
    quickly so fewer should die from being left ill
    and stranded.
35  By declaring the bucardo a protected species     
    people are alerted to its status as in great
    danger of being extinct and embark on schemes,
    such as making sure they are well fed, so that
    numbers begin to increase again. There may be
    campaigns against hunters or other human
    activities contributing to its fall in numbers.
36  Protecting it means to help it to survive by not 
    allowing it to be hunted, so it lives longer and
    can reproduce as produce more offspring to
    replace itself and the partner.
37  If it is a known protected animal people would   
    not be able to hunt it easily as that would be
    illegal. Therefore more would survive which
    could mate with others and continue the species.
38  Making an animal that has a low population a     
    'protected species' helps it survive because it
    then becomes illegal to hunt or kill them
39  making a protected species lets people know      
    becose, they put them on like wildlife programs
    to show , so hunters do not touch them, also
    their are signs up.
40  By making it a protected species special care is 
    taken out so that they are not killed for no
    reason, so that they can reproduce and increase
    in number again and prevent them being wiped
    out.
41  By making an animal protected it stands more     
    chance of survival, as it is not hunted for meat
    or pleasure. It is kept in it's natural
    environment without the threat of becoming
    extinct.
42  by doing so, you will let the animal reproduce,  
    and help it live longer and the numbers of the
    animal will increase, and special care will be
    taken.
43  People are more aware of the animal and the      
    animal is also protected this means that the
    animal by law can not be harmed.
44  Making an animal a protected species aids its    
    survival as certain laws will be passed that
    prevent humans hunting or killing these animals.
    If harm does come to the animals through human
    fault it would be regarded as a serious offence.
    The specific environment of the species would
    also be protected.
45  The community will help look after it and keep   
    track of how it lives and whether the animal is
    endangered where it lives. If it is, then the
    animal is provided another shelter.
46  It stops people from huanting the animal         
    capturing and hirting the animal and if anyone
    was court they would have to pay afine or go to
    jail
47  If they are protected species then it means they 
    are rare and are few of them. Which means there
    would probably have more food to eat.
48  If you kill a protected species you could        
    possible get sent to person for disobaying the
    law.
49  Making a type of animal 'a protected species'    
    increases peoples awarness that they are dying
    out and people can be prosiquted for killing
    them, so people stop killing them and they
    survive, hopefully.
50  It helps it because it gives the goat freedom    
    from man and other animals.
51  This is by stopping humans from making them      
    exstinct by killing them. So therefore nothing
    they need should be damaged.
52  It helps it to survive because it offers the     
    animal greater protection than it would
    otherwise have.
53  By making a type of animal 'a protected species' 
    means that it cannot be killed by man for
    entities like meat and fur. By being protected
    means that man also helps to prevent any harm
    coming to it.
54  The animal is acknowledged to be rare and people 
    know that it needs protection to be saved from
    exstinction. Monitors will be put on them so
    they are protected. People look after the animal
    and prevent it, from danger.
55  Making an animal 'a protected species' helps it  
    to survive because, by law, it cannot be hunted
    or killed by man and its habitat must be
    protected and left unharmed.
56  becauce and coun't be haunted down no more are   
    it would be extinked like the dowdow bird.
57  When this is done, it becomes illagel to disturb 
    them and destroy their enviroment. You are not
    aloud to kill or capture them. This allows them
    to grow and multiply without man killing them or
    interfearing.
58  people can't harm them anymore, people check     
    that they are ok and have food
59  It makes people more aware of the animal. It may 
    put them of hunting them. They may try and
    prectect the species if possible so they wont
    become exstinct
60  Because it makes people more aware of it, so     
    they are given extra care and treatment to keep
    them alive and reproducing.
61  this means they can't be hunted and that no-one  
    can destroy their habitat.
62  By making an animal a protected species, its     
    habitat becomes protected and it is illegal to
    kill it. This allows the animal to live longer
    so that hopefully, it can reproduce and
    replenish its species' population.
63  If an animal is a protected species then it will 
    be encouraged to breed more and will be kept in
    specialised areas where humans cannot bother or
    touch the animal. This means that animals will
    have special vets to look after them and
    constant food supplies.
64  Making an animal protected will meen it could be 
    illegal to kill them. Some may be kept in
    captivity & try to make them breed so there is
    more
65  If an animal is a protected species, it would be 
    more able to survive as it is being protected
    and especially looked after by conservationists
    which will prevent against human interference in
    a negative way and also natural harms to the
    animal.
66  When an animal is named as a 'protected          
    species', restrictions are put on the hunting of
    the animal, imposing fines on hunters and so
    preventing deaths in this way. The species may
    also then benefit from money for research into
    conservation as a result of its new status.
67  When an animal is a protected spiecies it means  
    that it is illegal to kill it therefore less are
    killed and the numbers don't decrease so much.
68  Making an animal 'a protected species' alerts    
    people to the fact that there aren't many left,
    which may mean that people change certain
    habits, eg. hunting, shooting. Sometimes laws
    accompany declarations of 'protected species'.
69  When animals are made 'protected species' people 
    try to ensure that these animals are not hunted
    or that their environments are not harmed. It is
    also that their food supplies are not damaged.
    These precautions protect the 'protected
    species' and make sure that the species can
    flourish in it's environment.
70  So they can produce more and not get killed by   
    man.
71  when an animal becomes a 'protect species' it    
    mean that it is illegal to kill or capture the
    animal and that these animals and their
    population numbers would be closely monitored.
72  If an animal's 'a protected species' it cannot   
    be killed purposely by man and it is looked
    after by wildlife trusts.
73  Making an animal 'a protected species' helps it  
    to survive as it makes humans aware of its
    limited numbers so they are not harmed. It also
    makes people who do harm them more weary of
    harming them
74  A protected species' is usually given more help  
    to survive than a normal species. It is
    generally observed, and all predators are kept
    away until the species is strong enough to
    survive on its own again.
75  they look after him, and that they know that     
    they are safe.
76  Because you can't go near the land or on it and  
    you can't touch or feed the animal, and people
    go and check it.
77  Making an animal 'a protected species' heightens 
    awareness of the plight of that animal, and also
    aims to reduce decrease in numbers, for example
    by preventing hunting.
78  So no one can kill it and it reproduces and they 
    can be protected
79  Making a type of animal helps it to survive      
    because they can make it breed or watch how it
    works to prevent extinction in the future
80  making an animal a protected species helps it    
    survive because it would be illegal to interfear
    with their habitate so their habitat will stay
    the same for them.
81  Making an animal a protected species helps it to 
    survive, as they will be kept in secluded
    mountains away from people ruining their
    habitats. The people looking after them will
    feed them, and focus on breeding.
82  Mountain Rangers look after them making sure no  
    Man can get to them
83  This means that measures are taken to ensure     
    that the animal stays alive. For example, people
    would not be able to hunt an animal that was a
    protected species.
84  A animal which is a protected species is not     
    allowed to be killed for any reason e.g fur,
    ivory. Also 'protected species' are given food
    and are helped to breed.
85  Its carefully watched and looked after.          
    Selective breeding could be used to enhance the
    number of animals
86  Because a protected species is a species         
    protected by the law. This involves law against
    poachers or other killing by man. Also
    conservationalists will protect their habitat
    and so they will be more likely to survive.
87  Once an animal has become a protected species,   
    humans are duty-bound to disallow any actions
    such as hunting it or destroying its habitat,
    thereby increasing its likelyhood to survive &
    reproduce.
88  If an animal is 'a protected species' then more  
    people are aware that they are there, and people
    would not do anything to jeopardise their
    survival.
89  It allows them to breed freely and live in free  
    dom. The maybe provided with food also.
90  It would have less of a struggle for survival    
    and therefore be able to reproduce and pass
    their genes to their offspring.
91  people protect the animal and stop hunting the   
    animal which makes it survive longer.
92  So it can protude offspring without having to    
    worry about man.
93  Animals are protected by law so anyone who is    
    caught hunting it can face serious penalties
    including prison. It's habitat is also well
    protected from destruction.
94  people are not allowed to hunt or kill the       
    animal and damages to its habitat are not
    allowed. People are also more aware of 'a
    protected species'.
95  By making an animal 'a protected species' people 
    try and protect the species and try to help to
    conserve them by giving money to build new
    habitats or by staying away from their original
    habitats
96  People are not allowed to hunt the animal.       
    Scientists may choose to prevent the animal's
    extinction by breeding them in a zoo or nature
    reserve. It would also raise awareness about the
    animal, and so people will take care not to
    disturb them or raise money for breeding
    programs.
97  If an animal is a protected species hunting it   
    and destroying its habitat is an offense
    punishable by law. If these kind of things are
    prevented the animal in question will live much
    longer giving it a change to procreate thus
    keeping the species alive.
98  If an animal is a 'protected species' nothing is 
    allowed to deliberately harm it.
99  They protect the animals as much as they can     
    from men and deforrestation.
10  This makes people more aware of a species'       
0   difficulty, and promotes conservation methods,
    such as preservation of habitat, bans on
    hunting, and breeding programs.
10  It helps the animal because the animal is given  
1   more rights, it would be illigal to kill it.
    Some may be kept in captivity to increase the
    numbers, before being released.
10  This measure firstly registers concern over the  
2   species so development in that area would be
    sensitive to the risk of destroying more of a
    dwindelling species habit and prevent illegal
    poaching by making it protected therefore giving
    punishments such as fines to those that harm
    them.
10  It stops the food chain that might occur. If     
3   (human) stop eating them they will increase in
    number.
10  it helps it to survive by declaring it a         
4   protected species meaning they are not allowed
    to be killed or poached, if they are caught they
    would land huge fines and jail terms. When
    protected allows them to reproduce without fear
    of poachers or hunter
10  It helps protect the animal. It will stop        
5   hunters killing the animal. As it is endangered
    people will want to protect it and help it
    survive
10  It means that the animal has to be looked after  
6   and that you oren't allowed to hunt it other
    wise you can go to jail or have to pay a fine
10  In doing so it makes it illegal to hunt the      
7   particular species of animal. It makes people
    aware of their limited numbers and more cautious
    about how animals are treated.
10  If an animal is a protected species, it becomes  
8   illegal for it to be killed for any reason.
    Fewer people, therefore, are prepared to kill
    the protected species, and fewer die.
10  because then there not allowed to be hunted and  
9   the popilalation of the animal is looked after.
11  protecting it will help it to survive as it will 
0   be kept an eye on more looked after
11  it makes it illegal to kill it and puts peaple   
1   watching and keeping an eye on them
11  because it makes it illegal to kill them, some   
2   are bred in wildlife parks & zoo's etc
11  A protected species can not be hunted or         
3   poached. If a protected species is not hunted,
    then there will be more of them to reproduce and
    increase their numbers.
11  because it stop people from hunting it or        
4   destroying it habitat giving it to bread more so
    it can get its number back up so it willn't
    become extinct
11  By making a type of animal 'a protected species' 
5   you are making it illegal to be killed by anyone
    and to protect it from predators.
11  Can ban man from harming these animals in any    
6   way.
11  It protects them by making it illiegal to kill   
7   or hurt the animal.
11  Making an animal 'a protected species' helps it  
8   to survive because it would be protected by its
    predators and other things - environment, to
    help it survive.
11  If an animal is made 'a protected species', then 
9   people would be more aware of it, and they would
    make sure as many of this species would survive
    and reproduce as possible.
12  By making an animal 'a protected species'        
0   scientists and people around the world become
    aware that it is in danger of extinction.
    Schemes are set up by wildlife organisations to
    monitor the situation and they set up breeding
    programs or protect the animals' habitat.
12  By making an animal 'a protected species' people 
1   are prevented from hunting or culling that
    animal. No action can take place whereby the
    numbers of the animal are decreased so it is
    allowed to thrive and regain its numbers.
12  Makes them seperate from any preditors which     
2   they might have. Protected species have all
    their needs e.g - warmth, food, water etc.
12  It makes it a illegal for man to kill it. It     
3   provides more protection for the species in a
    better habitat. The species is watched and
    looked after by people in control of protecting
    species.
12  Because it makes people more aware so they try   
4   to avoid things like building roads and cutting
    trees down.
12  This helps the animal because it becoms illegal  
5   to kill them. They can therefor reproduce more
    readily and it's numbers don't reduce unless its
    through Natural causes.
12  Man would stop taking actions that might         
6   decrease their numbers any further. They would
    probably leave their mounbtains alone and build
    factories elsewhere.
12  If the animal is protect no men can hunt it or   
7   destroy it's habitats
12  by making a type of animal 'a protected species' 
8   it allowes laws to be placed on the killing of
    it and concervation of it's habitat.
12  No man will hunt them and instead help to to     
9   survive so that the species will survive for
    longer.
13  by making it a protected species it can          
0   reproduced so there are lots More of the Animal.
13  If an animal is a protected species it means     
1   people can't poach it for its meat or fur. It
    also means that people will try to help it
    survive by giving it vaccines against diseases
    or taking it into captivity to breed. People
    will look out for protected species and be more
    kind towards them.
13  people are not alowed to hunt protected species. 
2   Protections may also be put on their habitat so
    they have places to live. undisturbed.
13  Because when there are more number of them the   
3   people will afraid of them and they can protect
    themselves to reproduce more of them.
13  This helps by letting people know that the       
4   species has nearly died out. There will be fines
    for hunters caught killing this animal.
13  By making a type of animal 'a protected          
5   species', you are helping it to survive by
    placing bans and laws against certain actions,
    such as hunting, for it. It also makes people
    more aware and perhaps willing to help to
    increase it's numbers.
13  It is looked after by wild life people and no    
6   one is allowed to kill it.
13  This helps as they can be kept in a safer        
7   enviroment away from harm of natural and man
    made disasters.
13  To make an animal 'a protected species' means to 
8   make if officially illegal for that animal to be
    hunted. It also means that increased attention
    will probably be paid to maintaining its
    habitat.
13  The type of animal is kept in the right          
9   environmental conditions, for example their is
    enough food and shelter for them. They are also
    bred carefully in the correct conditions
14  because it is protected                          
0
14  If an animal is a protected species it makes it  
1   illegal to hunt it, thus helping the species
    survive. Often protected species are kept in
    captivity, protecting them from predators and
    providing food to survive . Breeding is also
    encouraged here, helping the survival of the
    species..
14  When a species becomes a protected species it    
2   becomes illegal to kill this animal and its
    habitat is usually protected. This means its
    population is under less threat and may prosper.
14  People will take more notice of protected        
3   species. People will be aware that it is illegal
    to harm the animal and will realise it is close
    to extinction.
14  It makes some people know the boundarys and      
4   where they can and cant do distressing things
14  People will not be able to kill them as there    
5   are not many. People will be more aware and
    their land can be protected.
14  it means that you can't hunt the animal and are  
6   usually kept in pairs of male & female so they
    Reproduce
14  This would stop humans from damaging its natural 
7   habitat through deforestation and for crop land.
    Also, this makes it a criminal offence to be
    found hunting a 'protected species'.: this
    allows the indangered species to thrive again &
    breed.
14  If a type of animal is declared a protected      
8   species then it is illegal for them to be hunted
    or killed. It will also mean that some will be
    taken into captivity to be bred to try and
    increase the numbers.
14  A 'protected species' means that everything is   
9   ensured so that it may survive. Their habitat is
    protected and it is made illegal to hunt them
    down, so that it is more likely that it will
    reproduce easier and faster and in peace.
15  By making an animal 'a protected species',       
0   conservationists can ensure that its habitat is
    left undisturbed, furthering its chances of
    survival, and that the hunting of it is illegal.
    It may also make it possible to create a
    breeding programme for it or protect it from
    natural predators in order to increase numbers.
15  This helps a species to survive by making people 
1   more aware of the danger of the animal's
    exinction, and thus encourages those to be more
    careful in its habitat for example.
15  If a protected animal is made a 'protected       
2   species' this means that people are forbidden to
    harm its natural habitat or jepordise the
    factors which it needs to survive. It also means
    the animal is unable to be poached or killed in
    any way for human benefit.
15  Making an animal a protected species helps it to 
3   survive as it brings attention to it. Also it
    stops people from hunting them as penaltys can
    be large.
15  By making an animal a 'protected species' means  
4   that animal welfare groups could monitor the
    animal breeding activites to make sure theyre
    breed or making it illigal to hunt or kill these
    animals.
15  This means that the type of animal would be      
5   treated with great care and would be kept in a
    safe enviroment.
15  Making an animal a protected species, helps it   
6   to survive as it is not allowed to be hunted,
    also Man has to respect its enviroment and not
    disturb or destroy it, unnecessarily.
15  by putting them in a special habital so man      
7   cannot get to them
15  everyone is aware of this, and if people want to 
8   hunt them down, they either are at a huge risk
    of getting fined, or dont hunt them at all.
15  When an animal is declared a protected species,  
9   nobody can directly try to harm the animal and
    is protected from its habitat being destroyed.
16  A protected species will have a better survival  
0   chance because human activity against it would
    be restricted. e.g. poaching. Thus allowing the
    animal not to have human interaction to interupt
    its natural habitat or behavior.
16  By making a type of animal 'a protected          
1   species', scientists will try to do everything
    they can in order to look after the species and
    prevent them from damage, for example by
    removing any harmful litter from the area, etc.
16  It makes it illegal to kill the animal to        
2   enforce it's survival + also highlights the
    plight to potential buyers of the fur + meat who
    would then choose not to buy it + poachers would
    stop as there wouldnt be a market for it.
16  It just Protces it from man it Doesnt help it   
3   survive By natural Diasters
16  That way people might stop hunting it and then   
4   there will also be more people looking out for
    the animal trying the protect it.
16  Making a type of animal 'a protected species'    
5   helps it to survive because people are then not
    allowed to kill the animal or destroy it's
    original habitat.
16  When an animal is a 'protected species' it means 
6   humans are not allowed to do any harm to it, it
    is protected by the law. Instead people must
    make an effort to conserve it and not interfere
    with its habitat or lifestyle. It also means it
    will be carefully monitered and every effort
    made to help it to survive.
16  A protected species is not allowed to be harmed  
7   by humans: laws are passed to prevent shooting.
    There is also a raised awareness about the
    animal and its problems, which can encourage
    members of the public to help in its
    conservation
16  Making a type of animal 'a protected species'    
8   gives it certain rights. They are not allowed to
    be killed for meat by poachers and their natural
    habitat (the environment it lives in) has to be
    maintained and not directly threatened by
    humans.
16  These animals can be protected from preditors,   
9   breed to increase numbers and given the right
    food it needs to eat.
17  There are laws against hunting it and do things  
0   like building where it lives.
17  There are conservation groups that check on how  
1   the specie is surviving. They record results and
    help the protected species.
17  because there are less of them they no how to    
2   hunt for themselves & they don't get killed
    because not many people know what they are
17  When a type of animal is made 'a protected       
3   species' there are several benefits. Firstly,
    man's awareness of its plight is increased and
    so zoos may start to run captive breeding
    programmes to help. Also, it means that humans
    are not allowed to hunt it or kill it or destroy
    its habitat. Finally, numbers of the species or
    monitored.
17  If an animal is protected, it cannot be hunted   
4   thus this will not reduce numbers. It also makes
    people realise that it is necessary, to help
    this animal, so raises awareness. If animals are
    protected the area they live in may be conserved
    or various schemes to help it survive or
    increase numbers may be implemented. All this
    increases the size of the population
17  There are laws to stop actions such as hunting.  
5   Also people will try and breed the species and
    let them back into the wild.
17  Animals which are named 'protected species' are  
6   normally in danger of extinction. By giving them
    this label, the public may become aware of the
    situation. As a result the animal is more likely
    to survive as it may be hunted less, or caution
    may be taken by the public, while in its
    presence.
17  It lays down rules on how it can be treated and  
7   makes it obvious that killing or harming this
    animal is NOT protecting it. It should be seen
    as to be protected.
17  It makes people more wary of it and therefore    
8   more careful. They are less likely to do
    neglegent things that could endanger it. Also it
    makes them illegal to hunt.
17  If protected then that means that nothing is     
9   allowed to harm it unless it's natural e.g.
    disease. It helps it to survive as it means
    there is no outside interference with the
    animals way of life.
18  Making itself feel safe and knowing what they    
0   are doing to make itself feel at home.
18  Making a type of animal a protected species      
1   helps it survive because protected spiecies are
    usually low in numbers so making them protected
    gives them a chance to reproduce and increase
    the spiecies population
18  because they have extra special attetion and     
2   food given to them. People go out of there way
    to make sure stay strong and healthy.
18  If a certain human goes out to hunt for a animal 
3   and he or she finds out its a 'protected
    species' It means it protects itself or others,
    so its not worth hunting for.
18  If the animal is small in numbers a decision is  
4   made to protect them so that they can breed to
    regain the population.
18  If an animal is made a protected species it      
5   lowerrs the risk of it being hunted.
18  Because if the animal is a protect species there 
6   are not many of the animal so there is less
    competition for food
18  Because the animal get's better looked after and 
7   seen to other that if they just left it on it's
    own.
18  because conversatists will ensure that all       
8   possible dangers that could affect the bucardo's
    like pollution and leaving sharp objects behind.
18  making a type of animal a protected species      
9   helps it to survive by excluding it from any
    dangerous occurances that could lead to their
    death. They are protected by man to continue to
    breed them
19  because of the low numbers of the species it had 
0   been declared as protected
19  If an animal is 'a protected species' this       
1   usually signifies that it is a rare type of
    animal therefore humans ensure that there is the
    correct and sufficient amount of food that the
    specie requires as well as suitable living
    standerds. The 'protected species' are notified
    as rare and for the reason that they are
    decreasing they are looked after with care and
    monitered constantly.
19  As it is taken better care of, therefore will    
2   live longer if it gets the water and nutrients
    and food it needs. Also if it is living in its
    comfortable habitat.
19  By making an animal 'a protected species' the    
3   population is helped to survive. When an animal
    is 'a protected species' they are protected from
    dangerous things due to there lack of numbers.
19  By making a type of animal 'a protected species' 
4   it means to look out for their best intrests and
    help and give them what they need.
19  This means that it is close to extinction and so 
5   will be carefully watched to make sure that
    there are no predators around and that there is
    enough food available. Humans will make sure
    that there is little competition
19  By telling people a animal is a Protected        
6   species they will become more gentle with the
    animal
19  Nothing would be able to kill it as it would be  
7   protected.
19  If it is protected, then the species can face no 
8   ultimate danger that may harm it. For example
    making sure the species has a sufficient amount
    of food to help it to survive.
19  It encourages people to prevent actions which    
9   may cause it to become extinc e.g. hunting
20  Making an animal a ''protected species'' will it 
0   back off the brink of extinction. It also means
    you can't hurt the species.

1   Because high in the mountains it is not a        
    hospitable environment for humans and usually
    there are not conservation centres there so they
    have to be monitored somewhere else.
2   people don't know properly whats on the          
    mountains as people don't tend to live on them.
3   They are not seen that often, and it is hard to  
    keep tabs on them.
4   Because it would take ages to get to them and    
    then it made it dangerous for humans
5   The mountains are steep and are high up in the   
    air so the temperature is low and there may not
    be many other organisms living in such an area.
6   Not much human activity goes on in the           
    mountains, and they are difficult to get to,
    therefore it is harder to monitor whether the
    bucardo are being hunted or not.
7   It lived away from homes and people cant live on 
    it to look after them because of landslides
8   because even in high numbers they are rarley     
    seen due to their habitat so you can't watch
    their progress or see what people are doing to
    them
9   It was difficult because it would be very cold   
    and also it would be very dangerous for humans
    to be regularly in the mountains due to risks of
    landslides and other dangers. It also would be
    very hard to find the bucardo and keep track of
    its whereabouts.
10  becauce it would be hard to get up to them       
11  Mountains are big which makes it hard to find    
    and count each bucardo
12  They went places where it was very diffeicult to 
    find them.
13  It's hard to keep track of it.                   
14  As these are very difficult conditions to live   
    in and you need to be a good climber - therefore
    they are difficult to access and consequently,
    protect.
15  it was difficult place to monitor rather than on 
    flat plains.
16  because once they were widespread                
17  beouse in the high mountains it is cold and      
    there is less oxygen up there.
18  No man could get up there to protect it neither  
    can they take it away from its natural habitat
19  They had such a huge range of places to go and   
    they could get up places humans couldn't.
20  Because you cannot live in the mountains for a   
    long time because you need food & water to
    survive
21  It is a difficult species to protect because     
    they live so high up people cannot moniter them
    very well leading to innaccurate thoughts of the
    amount of them.
22  they could be hard to find to look after.        
23  hunters could by pase sucuroty becouse of the    
    vast area.
24  Rules are difficult to anyone high in the        
    mountains and it is difficult for humans to try
    and live up there and establish effective
    measures for its protection.
25  Because there could have been landslides, in     
    which the bucardo's could have died and also
    because they lived in the mountains it is hard
    to protect them because less people live on the
    high mountains.
26  Because it would have been difficult for man to  
    climb the mountain on a regular basis and it
    would have been hard to find the goat once
    situated on the mountain.
27  Because it could have fallen down the mountain   
    and they are so far away.
28  Mountains may cover a wide area of land.         
29  It will be difficult to monitor the bucardo as   
    mountains are less accesseble and the mountains
    will make it easy for both bucardos and hunters
    to hide from i.e, officials trying to protect
    the bucardo.
30  difficult to monitor and track the bucardo.      
31  As humans cannot live in the mountains easily so 
    we cannot keep close watch on them to look after
    them or protect them.
32  There would be many natural disasters such as    
    landslides which is more difficult to prevent
33  There is a widespread of land which is hard to   
    find so few species and to protect them. There
    is difficulty in transport to the montains as it
    is rocky + high
34  Because of the climate and rocky terrain in the  
    mountains and the danger of rodeslides etc it is
    a dangerous habitat to live. It is also hard for
    people to find and keep track of the bucardos in
    such a habitat
35  A mountainous enviroment is difficult to re-     
    create making controlled breeding difficult and
    it is also difficult to moniter and protect.
36  Not alot of people could look out for them and   
    made it easy for hunters to hunt them down. Alot
    of accidents could happen up high in the
    mountains
37  Because they could not easily be monitered and   
    the dangerous terrain of the mountain meant it
    was easy for them to be killed (Falling off the
    mountain, landslide)
38  Because the location is high, it is difficult to 
    transport the caring materials up to the
    Bucardo.
39  Because it is difficult to keep track of exactly 
    how many there are as they live in such remote
    places.
40  They would have been hard to get to and          
    difficult to treat
41  because it is harder for the people who are      
    protecting it to control what happens and maybe
    can't reach some of the places they goto
42  cant keep an eye on who goes up the mountains    
    and when
43  Because they would have been hard to reach and   
    therefore count population numbers or catch them
    and try and breed them in captivity.
44  The bucardo live across a vast area so it is     
    very difficult to count them and be aware of
    their progress.
45  Because it is hard to get to high in the         
    mountains.
46  One cannot protect them from landslides,         
    mudslides, earthquakes etc.
47  Mountains are hard for humans to access so the   
    mountains cannot be patrolled easily to prevent
    poachers
48  thin air for man to get to and to Dangerous      
49  Because not many humans, if any, lived there so  
    it would be hard to keep track of them.
50  It is difficult to access them and therefore     
    moniter their numbers in such high up and rocky
    areas, and difficult to police these areas
    against harmful factors.
51  People cannot or do not live in the mountains,   
    so they cannot (bucardo) be closely or daily
    monitered or easily detected as the environment
    is a difficult place to protect anything in it.
52  Mountain climates are very sparse, so the        
    habitat of the bucardo would of been small, the
    higher the mountain the less oxygen there is
53  It was probably hard to monitor its habitat as   
    it would be hard to view the whole area at once.
54  They couldn't be watched very well to look for   
    poachers.
55  As the majority of the human population does not 
    live high in the mountains, making it hard to
    reach and causing breathing problems due to the
    lack of oxygen. Furthermore it is harder to
    catch as humans are not adapted for the mountain
    environment
56  because its hard to get to mountains and the     
    humans can't get to all places the bucardo can.
57  because it is hard to reach the high mountains   
    because of the unstable surface.
58  It is difficult to monitor whether people are    
    killing them when they are in a remote area as
    it cannot be seen or heard often. It is also
    difficult to alert people of the problem.
59  This made it difficult to protect due to the     
    high mountains
60  The enviroment they live in is remote and it     
    would be difficult to watch and protect them
    constantly
61  Because it is difficult to survey all the        
    mountains to ensure illegal poaching is not
    taking place
62  This would make it a difficult species to        
    protect because the mountains take up such a
    large area of land it would be difficult to keep
    an eye on them in such a vast space.
63  mountains are extremely dangerous, with the cold 
    climate at the semit, the unexpected landslides,
    mountains are unstable.
64  Not many people live up in mountains so there    
    would have been less people to enforce it's
    protection and survival.
65  It would be hard for people to check whether     
    anyone is doing anything illigal.
66  It is not easy for people to set up wildlife     
    parks and such in the mountains.
67  It would be difficult to have a protective       
    barrier such as a game reserve in the mountains
    and the bucardos would not be able to be watched
    to see if any harm was coming to them.
68  Because it is a dangerous habitat to live in ie  
    falling trees and animals living there are prone
    to natural disasters. Also it takes people a lot
    more effort, and is a lot more dangerous to try
    and conserve them.
69  if it not easy to get there quickly or easily so 
    it would take time to get there if anything
    happened, and it would be harder to protect them
    there.
70  Because they are difficult for humans to reach   
    and it is a difficult habitat to replicate in a
    zoo.
71  because it is hard to get high up to make sure   
    if it was ok and you can not move it because if
    you do it not use to being on flat land.
72  It is hard to protect as man are unable to reach 
    such high areas to protect the animals. The
    conditions also make it hard for man to live in.
73  Because it would be hard to stop people getting  
    to theme.
74  because it lives high on montains it means that  
    it can not be rounded up and took to special
    reserve
75  It's hard for people to get up to the top to     
    help the bucardos because it may be quite
    dangerous
76  There may be other more dangerous types of       
    animal that may hunt them down for food.
77  The mountains made it difficult for human aid to 
    approach them. It is a hard area to cover.
78  It was difficult to get to.                      
79  because there are natural causes that can kill   
    the bucardo and if it is injured it is hard to
    go and give it medical attension
80  It was a difficult species to protect because    
    not many people could count its numbers or stop
    others from hunting, as not many people live or
    go up high in the mountains.
81  It is hard for people to reach high mountainous  
    areas. They would probably have to climb or be
    airlifted to reach the animals.
82  because the mountains are quite out of the way   
    therefore it is hard to keep an eye on the
    animals
83  because it is harder to reach them because they  
    lived so high up.
84  High in the mountains is more inaccesable for    
    humans. Not conveniant as limited transport and
    difficult weather conditions
85  Few live high upon the mountains and therefore   
    it is a difficult to help the Bucardo. It is
    difficult and dangerous to climb up the
    mountains to protect the animal - by bringing it
    food etc.
86  It is difficult to monitor the lifestyle of the  
    bucardo & it is difficult to look after them
    when they are so high up.
87  The mountain tops are hard to reach and probably 
    uninhabitable making it harder for man to
    protect them from hunters and also landslides.
88  It means that this rule can not easily be        
    enforced as there are no park wardens high up in
    the mountains also the number of bucardos are
    hard to find out because of the hostile terrain
    and so we don't know how many there should be
    and therefore if some ar
89  Because the mountains are very remote and it     
    would be difficult for scientists to get to
    parts of them.
90  As this is a hard place to moniter them as it is 
    difficult terrain to travel across.
91  It is a lot harder to get high into the          
    mountains and so this will be a big problem as
    in 1973 when the specie needed to be protected
    ther weren't as good technology as there is now.
    Also there are less to find making it harder.
92  It would be hard for people to record how many   
    there were.
93  It Is Hard to get Lots of people up Into the     
    mountains.
94  No human's live up in the mouintains to protect  
    it from other animals etc.
95  This would mean having to constantly climb the   
    mountains, to check the animals, it is also
    dificult to control the environment of a
    mountain as they are dangerous and wild.
96  It is difficult to get to them to protect them   
97  because the mountain is dangerous and could kill 
    them if they fell.
98  The fact they lived in mountanous areas makes    
    them difficult to protect possibly because of
    the unpreventable natural hozzards such as
    landslides.
99  they were too far away                           
10  Because the animal was so high up, so it was     
0   difficult to reach and not many people would
    want to climb a mountain to 'just' protect a
    species of animal who is most probably going to
    die anyway.
10  It is very hard to find them                     
1
10  because the fell of the mountains.               
2
10  It was difficult to find the bucardos as the     
3   terrain made it difficult for humans to get to
    their habitat. Therefore people couldn't find
    out what help the bucardos needed or why they
    were dying, or find bucardos so they could know
    how many there were.
10  Protectors would find it difficult to find and   
4   locate the bucardo
10  Because there out of sight, hard to find, and    
5   keep track of
10  There aren't many people up in the mountains to  
6   protect them.
10  because there are alot of natural desarsters in  
7   the high tops of mountains.
10  Because it is a difficult place to visit to      
8   track the progress of the species.
10  Because it would be difficult to get up to the   
9   mountains to keep track of the bucardo's
11  People cannot watch over the bucardo all the     
0   time because the area is large and too difficult
    to get to.
11  It would have been difficult for humans to       
1   travel up the mountains, as the terrain would
    probably be to steep and dangerous for cars or
    trucks to travel across.
11  Because they could fall off the mountain if they 
2   loose their balance.
11  the mountains cold and slipey so it was harder   
3   to protect them
11  They are hard to find and monitor numbers or     
4   rescue from dangerous situations. It also means
    they cannot be put into breeding programs as
    they are hard to catch.
11  The mountains are quite inaccessible and         
5   difficult to monitor regularly because there is
    no nature reserve in the mountains and they
    cannot be taken away from their natural habitat
11  People could not get to them. Difficult to       
6   capture, or get hold of.
11  because not many people live in mountains to     
7   protect them no one could keep an eye on them.
11  because you could never lived in the mountains   
8   because it would have been to cold.
11  It is hard to reach by humans.                   
9
12  It is difficult to track it, so calculations of  
0   how many there are are hard to make, and may be
    innacurate. It is also hard to moniter hunting
    high in the mountains.
12  because it might not be manageable for man kind  
1   to reach where bucardos live.
12  becouse its hard to get up into the mountains,   
2   so its hard to stop poachers. Also there are all
    the landslides and stuff.
12  It is hard to travel up mountains and so its     
3   hard to protect them as they are difficult to
    reach.
12  Because there cannot easily have rangers to      
4   check if they are surviving or if they are being
    hunted.
12  Living high in the mountains meant that it was   
5   fairly difficult for man to get up there and
    help it.
12  Because it's difficult to stop people from going 
6   up the mountains and killing them.
12  Mountains are a difficult area for humans to     
7   navigate, therefore they had less control over
    the protection, & couldnt encourage breeding as
    easily.
12  Few people live high in the mountains, and so    
8   their population cannot easily be monitored.
    Also, it becomes harder to look after them in
    such remote areas. Furthermore, it's habitat
    cannot be replicated in a zoo easily to prevent
    extinction
12  As the mountains are a vast area it makes it     
9   difficult to monitor there numbers and stop
    anybody trying to hunt them.
13  Hunters and country people would go shooting for 
0   a game and kill them.
13  high in the moutains people can spot you from    
1   far.
13  because you would have to keep track of it and   
2   this means climing the mountains.
13  because it is a large area to cover and it is    
3   difficult getting high up in the mountains.
13  It isn't likely many humans live up there so     
4   they wouldn't be able to monitor the species
    very well.
13  It would take too long to climb a mountain and   
5   look for every bucardo to put an electronic tag
    on it.
13  The mountains are more open and have lots of     
6   places they can hide like caves.
13  As there was no one close by to monitor the      
7   bucardos and what was going on.
13  It would be difficult for man to climb up to the 
8   mountain and help the animals because humans are
    not adapted to extreme situations. e.g. the
    height, surface (our feet don't grip).
    landslides make it dangerous to go up a
    mountain.
13  The bucardo was not surrounded by urban area's   
9   where people could check on them.
14  It is hard to control its surroundings and it    
0   was a hard environment to reproduce in
    captivity.
14  because its to high up and to far and ther are   
1   alot of other wildlife up there.
14  the goats lived high in the mountains so people  
2   could not get to the goat to protect them well
    enough
14  This made it a difficult species to protect, as  
3   they cannot take them to specific breeding
    grounds, and also they cannot prevent people
    from going onto a mountain.
14  Mountains are hard to transport essential things 
4   to, and many natural disasters (like landslides)
    occur easily there. It is difficult for humans
    to protect animals against such disasters.
14  people cannot move to the mountains to look      
5   after them and natural disasters cannot be
    prevented, The Bucardo is also likely to hide
    away and not be seen.
14  Because it will be hard to enclose them into a   
6   specific place for them to be protected.
14  because you will have to travel up there to see  
7   them.
14  It would be hard to enforce bans if no-one was   
8   nearby, it would be labour intensive to go so
    far away to the high mountains and it would be
    hard to reach them.
14  It is hard to controll what people are doing up  
9   a mountain.
15  Not many people would be around to help them or  
0   stop them being hunted.
15  This could have been because they are difficult  
1   to keep track of, or reach if they are in
    danger.
15  Mountainous areas are very hard to reach, so     
2   people can not tell if the bucardos are as
    protected as they should be and mountainous
    areas are hard to keep protected from harm.
15  Access to the goats habitat would have been      
3   difficult and possibly dangerous so it would be
    difficult for people to monitor and protect.
15  Well away from settlements and you cant close    
4   down a mountian just for the goats
15  Not many people live in the mountains so the     
5   bucardo could not be protected all the time so
    they were still dieing.
15  Cause they are hard to get to                    
6
15  High mountain areas are not easily accesible,    
7   and one reason why the goats lived there could
    have been to stay away from people. This means
    if people began to climb the mountain to protect
    them they would probably try to run away.
15  because its hard for us to survie in the         
8   mountains because of cold and its stepness.
15  Man was not designed to with-stand the climate   
9   in mountains so its hard to get to the
    mountainous areas that they inhabit to enforce
    this protection.
16  It is so high up and it is hard to look after    
0   ther and no one lived up there.
16  because it cost a lot of money to ensure the     
1   safety of a human when climbing a mountain.
    There fore even more money will be spent
    protecting the animal
16  mountain are big so large areas have to been     
2   cover to protect the bucardo
16  it was difficult to monitor the movement and the 
3   where abouts of the Animal
16  It could easily fall or there could be           
4   landslides.
16  Because although it is less likely that many     
5   humans will be around it often, natural
    disasters could occur ie landslides.
16  high up and hard to keeps numbers                
6
16  Mountains are not very accessible areas, and     
7   cover large areas. Hence it was difficult to
    accurately record its population and enforce
    anti-hunting laws.
16  the mountanious land would have meant man could  
8   not protect the bucardo by cars and the
    landscape would be difficult to cross quickly on
    foot. There would also be many hiden places
    where they could be. Also they would not be used
    to people and therefore m
16  Because nobody would really be able to keep an   
9   eye on it a hunters could still get away with
    killing them.
17  Not many people go high up in the Mountains      
0
17  As it would be hard to keep going up to monitar  
1   the animal there could be natural desetors that
    could kill animal
17  hard to get up there. Some people also cant be   
2   seen.
17  They lived high in the mountains where it is     
3   dangerous and trying to save them would be very
    difficult due to the risks involved
17  - Birds could attack it and eat it. - Humans     
4   can't get up to the mountains to protect the
    goat.
17  (too hard to get up there) As people do not live 
5   in the mountains so cannot find the goats and
    monitor them Hard to control preditors as well
17  Difficult access to high mountains. bad weather  
6   conditions for humans. need lots of equipment so
    can stay up there to look for them. Difficult
    access - hard to find.
17  Because they are alone and they cant really      
7   defend themselves
17  Not many animals lived high in the mountains for 
8   one, and for two there a same species of this
    type of goat.
17  because no other prediture could get to kill the 
9   species. If it was high in the mountain.
18  The mountains can be a dangerous ecosystem and   
0   its hard to protect the animals habitat when
    there are different climates and conditions high
    up.
18  because of the dry cold air no food              
1
18  No other species are adapted to living high in   
2   the mountains. They would not be able to
    survive.
18  people like to climb mountains so you can't stop 
3   them climbing for a goat
18  The bucardo is adapted to a not easily           
4   replicable environment, so ideally it would stay
    where it was, but then it is more at risk from
    hunters and must fend for itself
18  You could'nt group a hole load together to       
5   incourage them to breed.
18  because it couldn't be kept in captivity because 
6   it's adapted to living in the mountains.
18  It is dangerous for men to protect it because of 
7   tempeature and the amount of food they have.
18  The mountain could be a large one and maybe      
8   dangerous to try and catch one or many and
    protect them all.
18  because you cant catch them                      
9
19  The hight of the mountains and they may slip on  
0   a wet day.
19  The area that needs to be sectioned off is       
1   unknown because scientists don't know the exact
    place it lives. It is also very hard to section
    off a whole mountain top because it is used for
    other purposes by humans i:e farming.
19  its to high up for people to protect them.       
2
19  Because then they couldn't be in their natural   
3   environment they would have to adjust a great
    deal
19  They cannot be surveyed descretely, easily or    
4   often.
19  It couldn't be kept in a zoo because it needed   
5   certain conditions it was used to.
19  Because no-one can see you up there              
6
19  because the higher up the mountains the less     
7   amount of oxygen there is.
19  The mountains are dangoress and many would be    
8   killed by nature
19  Humans are not adapted to that kind of           
9   environment so they can't help any ill or
    injured Bucardo goats.
20  Bucardos could hide, hard to protect and         
0   mountain.

6   Whether it was morally right or wrong to do it   
7   They will then have to try and make another      
    bucardo the opposite sex to the other embryo
8   they will not have another bucardo to act as a   
    surrogate or host.
9   They do not have another Bucardo to implant the  
    embryo into so it will be difficult to implant
    it into another goat without its body rejecting
    it.
10  Turning the embryo into a foetus inserting the

17  Finding a female bucardo to put the embryo in so 
    it can develop.
18  They will not be able to reproduce because they

44  To make the species if it works.                 
45  They will need a host organism to implant the    
    embryo into. However, as all the bucardos are
    dead, this could pose problems.
46  How they will be able to make this organism      
    thrive again as they will have make other
    bucardos for the population to grow. Also where
    they will keep it.
47  an animal suitable for the embryo to be          
    implanted into.
48  where they will put the embryo for it to grow    
    into a feotus
49  Weather the bucardo embryo fertilises and or has 
    any deformaties.
50  it is difficult to get it to develop into a new  
    creature, it will not be adapted to its
    environment without a mother or family, and it
    will only be one bucardo, they would need to
    develope more to reproduce them also clones are
    more susceptible to disease
51  They would have to make two bucardo's for        
    offspring to be produced and therefore carry on
    genes
52  trying to protect them from hunters and the      
    cold.
53  How to let it grow, what animal to be it's       
    surrogate carrier, and if it will be alright and
    not have defects later on, as many clones do.
54  they will have to produce another one to mate

    people will want it.
56  trying to create amale bucardo to mate it with   
57  Keeping it alive without mother's milk           
58  In the past clones have started to show fast     
    signs of ageing eg, arthretis.
59  They will have no bucardos in which to insert    
    the embryo while it develops.
60  it is likely that it will be prone to disease.   
61  Where it can be implanted to grow and develop    
    into a baby because there are no bucardos left
62  they would not have a female bucardo to inject   
    it into and become its mother. Also there would
    be no variation of the species making it more
    vunerable to epidimics or climate change.
63  They need a living bucardo (female) to implant   
    the embryo into
64  Not being able to breed it, and arthritis        
65  managing to implant the embryo in the uterus of  
    a member of some other, similar species.

    will all be the same and they will never evalve
74  Finding a suitable "surrogate mother" to give    
    birth to the cloned bucardo.
75  Reproduction                                     
76  They need to put it somewhere safe to develop,   
    maybe in another womb.
77  World wide criticism, mainly from the media      
78  clones cannot reproduce so they will have to     
    clone every one.
79  Finding another bucardo to fertilise it in the   
    futre (breeding etc.)
80  they will have to make it able to survive and    
    reproduce with another cloned bucardo to produce
    more of the species.
81  Inherited disease cloning animals can easily     
    pass on a series of diseases
82  they will have the problem of hatching the       
    embryo.
83  They will have to transfer the embryo and place  
    it into the suitable species ready to reproduce,
    into the host.
84  How will they breed the animal?, They cant mate  
    it with itself.
85  The outrage from the media and religeous people  
86  They will have no female bucardo to plant the    
    embryo in the uterus as they are extinct.
87  How to develop the embryo into a 'baby bucardo'  
    that can survive on its own.
88  There are no other bucardo's left to implant the 
    embryo into.
89  finding another one to breed it with as if the   
    lone two and breed them, it will be deformed.
90  They will have to let the embryo grow but        
    without another animal to grow it in it will be
    hard.
91  What to reproduce it with or where to fertilise  
    it as where to fertilise it as there is no
    mother or womb.
92  They do not have another bucardo to implant the  
    embryo in to that the embryo can grow to produce
    a bucardo baby.
93  Where to grow the embryo                         
94  They dont have any other bucardo's for it to     
    mate with so cant reproduce them only clone
    them.
95  Finding an animal suitable to have the embryo    
    inserted into their womb.
96  They will have no bucardo to implant it into, so 
    it has no-where to grow.
97  farming the goat and letting it get all its      
    features before it would be born as it does not
    have the mother for the embryo to grow in
98  They will face the problem of their being little 
    genetic variation in its offspring.
99  finding a mate species                           
10  making another one so that they can reproduce.   
0
10  They have to insert it into the womb of a more   
1   common species, and then keep it alive when it's
    born.
10  There is no where to store the bucardo embryo    
2   e.g. no bucardo womb.
10  Find a surrogate mother suitable to bring up     
3   bucardo. To produce a breeding couple to
    repopulate would mean making another clone >
    reduced gene pool > geneticially identical >
    reduced resistance to disease.
10  how will it reproduce if they haven't got a male 
4   clone
10  getting it to reproduce, as the clone would be   
5   of the same sex as it's 'mother' & there would
    be no one for it to mate with
10  (1) Putting it in a uterus of an animal that can 
6   give birth to it, Keeping it alive, having the
    correct immunuties and food to give it. It will
    also be tame.
10  They have to find a surrogate to carry the       
7   embryo, but as there are no bucardo left this
    will be difficult.
10  They will struggle to get it to grow healthily   
8   without its parent, and then they will not have
    another bucardo to mate it with to create the
    next generation
10  getting another one for it to mate with of the   
9   oposit sex.
11  Where to insert the embryo to allow it to        
0   develop, as the specie is extinct.
11  The bucardo will not be able to procreate as the 
1   only sample with which to clone is another
    bucardo female. Therefore they will only ever be
    able to make female bucardo
11  They will need to find an animal that could act  
2   as a surrogate while the embryo develops.

4
11  They wouldn't be able to give birth to it as it  
5   isn't inside another animal
11  They will need one male and one female the would

12  They have no bucardo's left to insemenate the    
0   embryo with.
12  They would need to find a suitable animal to     
1   place this clone in. Then they would have to
    breed a male vertion.
12  feeding it and producing a male as cells where   
2   only taken from a female.
12  They won't be able to mate the bucardo so they   
3   will have to clone the bucardo again and all the
    bucardo will be genetically identical meaning
    they will be more succeptibility to diseases.
12  There will not be a male bucardo for the female  
4   clone to mate with.
12  what to plant it into?                           
5
12  They will face the problem of breeding them      
6   because they will be from the same cells.
12  They will find it difficult to protect and it    
7   may be succeptible to or spread new diseases.
12  They will need to find it a mate so that it can  
8   produce offspring
12  they will only be able to reproduce by mitosis   
9   which would only provide a genetically identical
    partner for the clone to mate with
13  Many cloned embryos do not mature correctly,     
0   resulting in deformations and miscarriages. A

13  Clones often have health problems. Also another  
7   must be made in order to them to reproduce.
13  They have to insert the embryo into a mother     
8   which will be a problem as there are no more
    bucardos.
13  They would have to find a surrogate mother for   
9   the embryo whose womb would not reject the
    embryo as a foreign organism.
14  There will be no other bucardo for it to         
0   reproduce with.
14  The embryo must be implanted into the womb of an 
1   animal, but as no bucardos are left it may be

16  Finding another animal or an artificial womb     
2   suitable to implant the embryo so that it can
    develop into a foetus and then a baby goat.
16  The animal will not be able to reproduce         
3   sexually, because it will not have a mate so all
    bucardo's will have to be cloned and that will
    be no variation in the species
16  Trying to recreate an entire species from one    
4   animal, with no access to reproductive cells of
    the opposite sex.
16  They would need a carrier to grow the embryo.    
5
16  Then it will be difficult because a surrogate    
6   mother must be found in which the embryo can
    develop
16  They won't have a bucardo sperm cell to          
7   reproduce a feotus

17  They will need to implant the embryo into        
4   another species of goat to gestate.
17  It will have to be planted in a womb of another

    clones especially with infertility.
17  How to grow the embryo as there are no more      
7   bucardo's to grow the embryo in there whooms.
17  varing the type of bucardo otherwise they will   
8   all be the same.
17  There are no other bucardos left to mate with it 
9   so the species will die out, also which animal
    to be a foster mother to the bucardo.
18  They would have to artificially grow the embryo, 
0   also cloned species are liable to health
    problems as - well. It would also be hard to
    breed more
18  They will have to provide a decent environment

18  They would have to implant it into another       
6   animal as there are no female bucardos left
18  They will only have a bucardo of one sex so it   
7   will not be able to reproduce.
18  they will have no bucardos to carry the embryo & 
8   give birth to it.
18  producing another bucardo which will be able to  
9   reproduce with the first to create fertile
    offspring.
19  lack of variety in the bucardo population makes  
0   them vulnerable to new diseases due to a reduced
    gene pool of the New bucardo population.
19  They will have to reproduce a womb for the       
1   embryo to grow in.
19  They may not know where to put the bucardo       
2   embryo, and how to make sure it grows in correct
    conditions (like the womb of the mother)
19  The cloned bucardo will not be able to reproduce 
3   because it needs a mate and there is no male
    bucardo for the female bucardo to produce
    offspring with.
19  They will have to produce another for it to      
4   eventually mate with, but there will be no
    genetic variation so the species would not be
    able to adapt
19  a decrease in the variation of the gene pool,    
5   Also the fact that the bucardo's are extinct,
    creates the problem as to which organism the
    embryo should be placed in - surrogacy. The
    embryo needs to be injected into a uterus for
    development.
19  The embryo cannot be put in a mother's uterus as 
6   bucardo has extincted.
19  Breeding the Bucardo because if they are all     
7   male there are no females, or vice versa and
    they can only make one gender from the sample.
19  breeding the animal, they only have the tissue   
8   of a female bucardo.
19  They will have to find a host animal to implant  
9   the embryo into who is compatible & whose body
    will not reject the embryo.
20  They will have to implant the embryo into a      
0   different species

1   Producing human cell clones will be useful for   
    people with incurrable diseases such as cancer,
    which can only be cured by receiving a healthy
    organ through transplant. If cloning became
    possible (legal) then healthy organs (tissue)
    will always be available for transplant. Some
    people object to cloning because they are afraid
    that it will escalate to the stage where
    complete human clones are created, and then
    individuality (as well as unique human rights)
    will be lost.
2   cloneing human cells mean terminal illnesses can 
    be cured. people disagree with this because they
    belive its playing God with some one life.
3   It is possible to produce clones of human body   
    cells and it could be very useful as we could
    make exact coppies of our blood incase a blood
    transfusion was needed and also sperm and egg
    cells so a new life could be genetically
    created. Sum people object to this as they feel
    it is unnatural and inhumane.
4   It might be useful beacause we can replace or    
    damage cell with good ones that work then most
    deasises could get wiped out. Might be a problem
    because problems which could cause ethical
    problems because in the process alot of embroys
    are destroyed
5   This mAy be useful to cure genetic diseAses or   
    diseAses which cAn be cured by replAcing the
    infected cells. Some people mAy object to this
    As they Are religious And believe thAt god
    should be the only one to creAte life.
6   Cloning human body cells would be very useful    
    for organ transplants. A donor would not be
    required, and as the organ would be made from
    the cells of the recipient, there would be
    almost no risk of rejection. However, some
    people object to this, as there are many moral
    issues involved. Some may argue that it is wrong
    for scientists to "play God". Others may be
    worried that this could allow the creation of
    things such as "designer" babies, or
    replacements for dead children, as these could
    appear to decrease the value of human life.
7   It may be useful because maybe it saves a life   
    by bringing in another etc. Some people object
    to this because they believe that making another
    human by hand is not right, that is like saying
    they are good, they are messing with nature. And
    it is only god who can bring or take lifes, that
    is why many people object to cloning.
8   This may be useful because if people have        
    genetically sound body cells, clones can be
    produced to prevent other humans from suffering
    genetic disorders and the embryo can be inserted
    into the mother. Some people object to this
    process because they believe it is playing god
    and messing with nature.
9   This may be useful as it means that healthy      
    offspring with desirable characteristics can be
    produced. many people object due to ethical
    reasons and it also can be very dangerous if it
    reaches the wrong hands.
10  This may be useful if someone needs a transplant 
    but has no matching doner. Disadvantage being if
    it causes 'the clone' to die. People also think
    it is wrong to 'Play God' (so to speak)
11  This could be useful because it is a new         
    technology and people may want clones of
    themselves, people may also object because it is
    not natural and highly dangerous.
12  It may be usefull because if someone was born    
    without a usefull cell then they could clone it
    and use it to save their life
13  It may be useful because people who are ill and  
    need cells to be replaced can have the correct
    cells cloned and inserted so they become well.
    Some people object because they think it would
    be used to create doubles of everyone which is
    not what nature intented.
14  Making clones is useful as it can help fight     
    diseases, act as an organ donor by having a
    replicate of a particular organ. Furthermore
    people could clone a person who is going to die
    or is dead. People may object to this process as
    they do not believe it is natural way for humans
    to be born.
15  This would be able to makes exact copy's of      
    humans who may have diesese but without the
    diseases. People object to the process because
    it is against human rights for people to choose
    who lives and who dies.
16  Because if humans ever become extinced they can  
    clone the last few and make more. People protest
    this because they dont think it is right to
    clone people so they object.
17  so you can live forever but some people thinks   
    its wrong.
18  This may be useful to doctors because if there   
    is a patient with a kidney failure it would be
    possible to clone the working kidney and replace
    the damaged kidney. Organs would be easily
    replaced. Some people would object because they
    feel that it is tampering with nature and is not
    God's doing. They also feel that people might
    get carried away and start cloning people.
19  Clones could be made of organisms which would    
    greatly facilitate organ transplants since there
    would be no danger of the body rejecting the
    organ. However, some people object because they
    feel it is morally wrong to create something
    just for organs. Some people feel that nature
    should not be interfered with too much.
20  It is possible to build a new organ for someone  
    whose original one is defective or absent from
    their own tissue so it will not be rejected. It
    is also possible to clone entire humans for an
    infertile couple or other person or persons
    wishing but unable to have children. However
    this means the child will be a replica of its
    parent which may offend its individuality.
21  It could be useful to help people over come      
    diseases where the cells are lost. People object
    to it because people dont want baby's being
    produced in this way where you can chose what it
    looks like.
22  human body cell clones are useful for seriously  
    ill people who need them to survive. But, some
    people disagree with it because there is only
    supposed to be one of everyone
23  often religious people object as they see        
    cloning as 'Playing God.' Also cloning can have
    serious side affects possibly causing cancer.
    However it is useful as it ensures identical
    organisms. For example cloning of a plant which
    is healthy and useful ensures the daugthter
    plants are identical.
24  It is useful so it can make people remember the  
    bucardo but some people may object to this
    because they might want to remember it for what
    it was.
25  It may be useful because it would help people    
    with such diseases as bone maro to find a donor.
    But some people may object because they might
    start producing actual clones. of people.
26  It is useful to clone humans because it means    
    they can enhance the human body to make it
    susceptable to certain diseases and will
    increases peoples chances of survival. Other
    people will object to this because they believe
    that nature should run it's corse and not be
    altered or interfered with by creating clones.
27  If a family member needs a transplant but cannot 
    find a suitable match then a healthy clone can
    be born. Then the specific organ can be taken
    from the clone, which although saves the
    original person, effectively kills or causes
    risk to the cloned human's life, which can be
    seen as inhumane.
28  Producing clones of body cells, such as liver or 
    kidney cells could provide healthy copies of
    damaged organs, creating a cure for many
    diseases. Some people object to this as
    unethical as it seems to be 'playing God'.
29  Clones of human body cells could be useful       
    because then people could have only good and
    desirable traits such as intelligence and
    beauty. Some people object to this process
    because if everybody used cloned human body
    cells, there would be very little genetic
    variation in the human race, some people also
    argue that it is a bad thing because it is not
    natural, and therefore not a moral thing to do.
    - it is not meant to happen.
30  This is useful because it can prevent mutation   
    and allow people to be produced with certain
    desirable qualities such as intelligence,
    sportiness etc. However, it is questionable
    whether it is morally right to do such a thing
    as it means loss of identity for clones and
    those they have been cloned from. and there is
    also the danger that they will not live very
    long, as it is suspected clones do not which
    makes it all the more wrong to ''create'' a
    person unlikely to survive and without a true
    identity.
31  It could be useful as it could lead us one day   
    being able to grow organs for transplants. But
    people object as it is not natural and could
    lead to some kind of 'super' human.
32  Producing human clones can give people the       
    choice to have children. People object to this
    because it can be damaging for people involved.
33  If cloning were used alongside artificial        
    selection and genetic engineering it might be
    possible to create a better adapted society.
    Cloning and genetic engineering could have
    unforseen repurcussions on ecosystems. It could
    also take away the variational qualities, which
    make us human
34  It is useful if we wanted to create talented     
    people or tall people etc. People may object,
    because they feel that it is unnatural and
    wrong.
35  i could be usefull to people who are born        
    handicaped you can make a clone for them.- but
    people who dont agree one can stop it happening
    due to being a different religion
36  This may be useful because it would mean that    
    vital organs could be produced, for transplants
    and there would not be any chance of rejection.
    Some people object to cloning, because they feel
    it is wrong to interfere with nature, on such a
    scale.
37  This can be very useful because people may have  
    certain organ diseases, whereby they need a new
    organ it can be hard to find a doner, however if
    they use cloning, then a healthy organ could be
    created. However this may have to be created
    through a human and it is thought to be
    ethically wrong to clone.
38  Cloning is a useful way of replicating           
    organisms, it could be used to test possible
    cures for serious illnesses. Some people may
    object as they feel it would be ''ethically
    immoral''
39  Clones may be used to provide organs for people  
    who need organ transplants, if there are none
    available. They could also be uded for testing
    out medecines that would be used for the benefit
    of mankind. However, there is an ethical issue
    in that people consider this 'playing god', and
    think that creating a human merely to destroy it
    for its organs is wrong.
40  They would want to produce clones of human body  
    cells, if that inparticular human cell has
    characteristis that can fight disease, this will
    be objected to because of some religious reasons
    and also because the process can be very
    expensive and difficult to carry out.
41  Yes is is possible to produce clones of human    
    body cells. It may be useful as it could cure,
    and illiminate many genetic diseases, i.e cystic
    fibrosis. However some people object as they
    feel it is like playing gd.
42  This could be useful because it would help       
    people who have incurable deseases such as
    cystic fybrosis. But some people object because
    they believe that this would lead to humans
    putting a price on human lifes.
43  It is possible this could be useful to re live   
    people when they have died. People could object
    becuas they say if you die it was ment to be and
    that science and experimenting is wrong.
44  This may be useful to produce offspring free of  
    disease but some people may object to it because
    it can be seen as unethecial as it is
    interfering with natural reproduction. It can
    reduce the gene pool if performed on a wide
    scale which means as well as a lack of diversity
    a specific disease could affect more people due
    to genetic identicality than had cloning not
    have been performed. Also, things in the cloning
    process may go wrong and the human baby may be
    deformed in some way, whch is unfair on the baby
    who has to live like this.
45  Human cloning would be able to help a person who 
    has a disease, by romoving the effected tissiue
    and replaceing it with the fresh clean one from
    the clone, But then the clone would be killed,
    and that what people object to.
46  Some people think that they can make their baby  
    have no diseases but others think that this will
    lead to 'designer babies', which isn't what
    human life is about and is not what God wanted.
47  This may be useful in procedures such as skin    
    grafts, where new skin can be produced instead
    of taken from elsewhere. Some people object to
    this in case there is a defect or fault in the
    process, which could be harmful.
48  yes it is possible, it could be useful because   
    you could create an ideal and perfect person but
    it would be playing god that is why a vast
    number of people object to this solution
49  It may be useful because it would be like having 
    a younger version of you but some people may
    object because there isn't any need for two of
    the same person.
50  It is possible to clone human body cells. It has 
    been used to try and investigate how patients
    might benefift from diseases. some people object
    because they belive it is wrong to reproduce
    humans so that they can be subjected to tests
    and experiments to see how the medicin, that is
    being tested for public use, might benefit or be
    a disadvantage to those who have diseases.
51  Some people object to cloning as they think that 
    scientists are trying to play the part of God.
    It also may be useful as people who cannot have
    babies can use cloning to produce children. The
    cost of cloning would be high so that is why
    some people might object to it.
52  Producing clones of human body cells can be      
    beneficial for example cloning human insulin
    cells for diabetes sufferers. Some people object
    to it because so little is known about the
    process. Also when trying to put new DNA into a
    new nucleus, it is very difficult to get it in
    the right place.
53  It would be useful to cure diseases and replace  
    broken or damaged cells. Some people object to
    this process as it is seen as unnatural and
    there isn't strong evidence that it will work
54  Yes it is possible and this will be good people  
    how need eg bone marow transplants. Some people
    object to this as its like 'playing god'
    creatting humans for specific requirments.
55  If the population of the world decreases clones  
    can be produced to help the human spieces
    survive. It is objected by people as it is not a
    natural life. And at the moment if a human clone
    was produced it would spend it's whole life in R
    & D.
56  This may be useful if a couple would want their  
    child to have Psfic features such as blue eyes
    or blonde hair, however some People tend to
    disagree. And argue that this Process involves
    risk and it is morally innapropriate to be so
    concerned with the way your child will
    physically look.
57  it may be useful because you could tell what     
    your baby could be before it is born. people
    object to as its not natural to look into the
    future of what your baby should look like they
    think its not right.
58  Some people object because of ethical reasons,   
    or they might think it is unsafe, it can never
    be 100% safe. It maybe useful as you could get
    rid of a disease the baby might have.
59  This could be useful for cloning scientists or   
    geniuses who would carry on their work as a
    clone. People object, however, due to its moral
    issues. It is also known that clones do not live
    very long and people have not thought about
    feelings of the clone
60  This may be useful if we start to become extinct 
    but people object because of the experiments on
    humans and the fact it will not know how the
    live a normal life.
61  You could grow body parts for people who needed  
    it. People would object to it because they would
    think it's sick and its from some one elses
    cells.
62  This may be useful for transplant operations     
    where the organs are not available. This would
    be useful as many people on waiting lists for
    organs would be treated more quickly and would
    have a better chance of staying alive. People
    object to this as they think that cloning is
    like 'playing God' and that doctors should not
    have this power.
63  It may be useful as clones can be made of        
    important substances eg, Insulin for diabetics,
    or the blood clotting gene for haemophiliacs.
    However some might think it is ethical wrong
    because mutations might occur and it is also
    copying the genetics of another human making
    them identical cells.
64  By being able to clone parts of the human body   
    will mean that in the future people will be able
    to cure diseases in the body, people who have
    lost parts of their body could have them
    replaced and transplants won't be as difficult
    to have due to matches. However, the ethics of
    cloning mean that people fear the idea of
    clones. They are scared we will become a society
    of clones.
65  If a couple have a high chance of passing on an  
    inherited disease to their child then it can be
    used to find a cell that does not have the genes
    + then copy this to produce a healthy child.
66  Some people might object because they see them   
    as an unatural living species and they do not
    want the population taken over by clones.
67  It is useful because you can have a person who   
    is the same who has the persons genetic
    strengths. People are against cloning because
    deseases could spread easerly if there were many
    people who were clone
68  This could be useful because we could make a     
    clone of the cleverist person or tallest person
    to use them for something useful. People object
    to this because the is a big chance something
    will go wrong and they could probaly die from
    something.
69  By detecting a gene that is particularily useful 
    to humans, such as a gene resistant to a
    particular disease, we can produce clones which
    show this particular trait. This is a quick way
    of producing many clones resistant to disease
    andmore able to survive yet these genes may have
    an unknown effect and defects in the genes would
    also be passed on and passed on to many
    offspring, not just the (if many clones are
    produced). Finally people question the status of
    a human clone in a normal environment and
    whether playing god is the right thing to do
70  This may be useful, because if a couple wanted a 
    baby to look a certain way they could pay for it
    to be done. Some people object to it, because
    they think that you should let nature take its
    course.
71  This may be useful for reconstructive surgery    
    such as skin grafts or replacement of an organ
    lost in a accident. This would mean that there
    wouldn't be a shortage as there is now, with
    donor organs. Some people object, as they feel
    that if cloning is used for small things, people
    may then want to clone a human being and a
    danger arises of ' identical races / humans.'
72  Yes, it is possible to produce clones of human   
    body cells. It would be very useful to do this
    to prevent desease in an embrio or produce
    selectively breed animals. Some people object to
    this because it can cause mutations and can be
    seen as morally wrong.
73  This is useful for situations such as heart      
    transplants as spare hearts are not always
    available, to be able to culture a healthy one
    would be useful. However, it is not natural to
    clone something so some people object especially
    when attemps are made to clone a whole human as
    there are many moral issues.
74  It can be useful to re-grow human body parts, eg 
    breasts after breast cancer but people are
    worried it may get out of control, as all you
    need from a person is one cell. It would be
    difficult to moderate, people could be cloned
    without their consent. It would change life as
    we know it and is an unnatural process if it is
    done by scientist.
75  It may be useful to clone skin cells because you 
    could grow a lot at a fast rate and then it
    could be used on a skin graft. Some people
    object because it isn't a natural life process
    to do.
76  It is possible to copy human cells, as proved    
    with the mass production of insulin formed from
    cuttings of human DNA. Although many oppose this
    as it seems an intrusion on G-d's work. They do
    not believe it is ethical to 'produce' life in
    this way.
77  Cloning is useful as we are able to obtain the   
    most desired characteristics and reproduce them
    and then find new cures for diseases. Some
    people consider this unethical and 'playing
    God'. It is also useful because we are able to
    determine society and prevent outbreaks of
    illness.
78  Clones of human body cells may be useful because 
    diseases could be fought. Some people object to
    the cloning process because it is seen as
    unnatural and wrong. They also believe that
    things could get out of hand if scientists start
    to produce clones of living people without
    permission or thinking of the consequences.
79  This way be useful as the cells of organs which  
    have failed in patients can be cloned, enabling
    a new organ to grow in the damaged organs
    place., thus improving the health of the
    patient. The organ is also not rejected by the
    patient's body, as some donor organs are. Some
    people object to this process as it involves
    embryonic stem-cells which are cloned from the
    individual. The use of embryos ie. a new life is
    seen as immoral. Some people also object as they
    do not believe that humans should interfere with
    nature an 'play God'.
80  Yes, it is possible to produce clones of human   
    body cells. This is useful if you want to
    produce an army to go to war, but some people
    object to this process because they think it
    isn't right to make a clone, you should just
    leave people alone.
81  This could mean that people could have an exact  
    double that would live on even if they died also
    if a human has died, you may be able to
    recarnate them. Some people object because it is
    not alway quaranteed to work.
82  it may be useful because it could result in      
    cureing a disease, people may object because it
    isn't nataral and things could go wrong.
83  It is useful because it would make it possible   
    for infertile people to have children. Some
    people object because tampering with human body
    cells is dangerous and the clone can have many
    problems due to side effects.
84  It would be useful as it would be a breakthrough 
    in science, but it would be going against the
    cause of nature so some people would object to
    this. But it would help scientists to find out
    more about cloning, its effects and problems.
85  It is useful in order to make hormones, such as  
    insulin, that could be injected into someone who
    does not produce enough. It can also help
    infertile couples produce offspring. Some people
    object to this process as they believe it is
    unnatural and only G'd can decide whether or not
    couples should be fertile or a person should
    produce a certain hormone.
86  Producing clones of humans may be useful for     
    making donor organs and real limbs when they are
    needed because they are living and the genetic
    information could then come from the patient,
    these extra organs would not be rejected by
    their body, as the rejection of organs is such
    an important issue in helping patients needing
    heart and kidney transplants, etc. Some people
    object to this process because they object on a
    moral level, where life should not be produced
    but created.
87  Human clones could benefit some people who want  
    identical children, or say a fashion company
    that wants to clone a model who they believe is
    'perfect' for their needs. However, many believe
    it is not ethical to clone humans as it is
    messing with nature and leaves no scope for
    variation, and so it is now illegal to clone
    humans.
88  Some people believe that cloning is incorrect    
    because we should not be interfering with its
    nature and we should not try to mimic the
    reproduction cycle. It may also be useful
    because we will be able to find out cures for
    medicinal uses.
89  This may be particurlarly useful for people      
    suffering from paralysis, who may need a stem
    cell which has been cloned or for people who
    need organ transplants some people object to
    this because they feel it is morally wrong and
    it could lead to other things, such as cloning
    of a whole body. Some may also be worried by the
    idea of the creation of a genetic hierachy,
    where people who are not perfect are shunned
    from society.
90  It is useful so if some one has an accident they 
    could use the system to save that persons life,
    many people object to this as it is not natural
    and are going to far beond the way of life.
91  Cloning of human body cells could help to fight  
    disease by finding new cures. Some people object
    because it is unnatural to produce clones.
92  it would be usefull becouse if we could clone    
    harts and other organs less people would die of
    heart desise and the waiting list for new harts
    would be cut dramatically.there are however
    people (mostly religeouse) who believe it is
    wrong for people to tamper with nature and
    ''gods creations''
93  This may be useful to a person who needs a       
    transplant of some sort and needs a match in
    blood. They can use the clone for that. People
    object to this because it takes their freewill.
    They don't want another one of them walking the
    streets.
94  it could be usefull because it could be used to  
    cure disease some people think that the
    origional cells may reject the new clones
    however.
95  Cloning body cells would be very useful if they  
    could be used to clone body parts and organs, so
    that transplants would be a lot easier. People
    object to the process of cloning because it is
    utterly untraditional, and is unnatural.
    Religious people would especially object, as
    they would see it as going against one of God's
    processes - birth.
96  It maens that you could make exact replicas of   
    children. but then every one won't be original
97  -                                                
98  It would be useful because it would mean that if 
    an organ transplant needed to happen, it would
    be able to without searching for a donor. People
    object to this as they see it as unnatural.
99  Clones of humans could be very useful for        
    medical purposes; exploring causes of
    particulary genetic disease and for
    experimenting with cures. Many people do have
    objections because the clones would in many
    cases be used solely as test objects and what
    right do we have to use other human beings for
    such a process. Furthermore it would take away
    human individuals if a copy could be made and it
    is against many relegious beliefs
10  It could be useful as a clone could be used for  
0   badly needed organ transplants, and for women
    who can't conceive their own child. It is
    opposed because it is said by religious people -
    against the act of god and mother nature.
10  It would be useful to do this because we could   
1   make bone marrow or new organs to be implanted
    into ill people. People object to this because
    they fear that whole people would be cloned
    which would be unethical.
10  Cloning a human body cell can be beneficial for  
2   some. A clone of oneself would be beneficial if
    a person had to have an organ transplant and
    needs a particular organ with tissue the same as
    theirs. Yet some may object as some regard the
    process as de-humanising and acting as though
    they are ''Playing God''
10  It is possible because some scientists do clone  
3   humans cells. Some people object because it
    could be dangerous or risky.
10  If someone has a good, strong part of the body,  
4   i.e a liver cell, then clones can be made to
    produce more of the ideal cell. These can then
    be placed in people who have that weak cell, to
    help their body function easily and better. Some
    people say it is not just, not right to have
    part of someone else in you. Some say it is
    morally wrong and goes against beliefs of being
    created and remaining as you are.
10  Its useful for medical reasons, for example      
5   blood transfusions or transplants etc as the
    body wont reject it as its the same. People may
    object as they say that people shouldn't
    interfear with nature, they should let it run
    its course.
10  It is useful because a cloned person could give  
6   organs for transplants for the original. Some
    people object because it is wrong to play god,
    and also if this technology fell into the wrong
    hands anything could happen.
10  It may be useful, if someone was dying because   
7   of a faulty organ, a clone of a good organ would
    be made to replace bad one. People object
    because they think it's messing with god,
    denying what should happen, avoiding fate.
10  This could be very useful for transplants and    
8   blood transfusions. However people object
    because they feal that you are creating
    something living only to destroy it.
10  Means examining dead people. People would say it 
9   invaision on their body. It can be useful to
    find out new things about our bodies.
11  It would be useful to produce clones of human    
0   body cells as they could be used in medicin as
    donar body parts are in constant demand and are
    very difficult to match correct blood types.
    Some people object to this as they feel it is
    cruel to create this person or cell for the sole
    purpose of donating organs or blood.
11  This may be useful to fight diseases. Some       
1   people are against it because they believe it is
    un-Holy!
11  cloning human cells could be very useful, they   
2   could be used for transplants, but many people
    say it is unnatural and could be dangerous.
11  Scientists could use cloning to produce organs   
3   in which they could use to save the dying by
    giving them organ transplants which gives them
    more chance of survival.
11  Cloning can be useful, but is also               
4   controversial. By cloning human body cells,
    cures for many diseases could be discovered, and
    thus diseases that were previously fatal could
    be thwarted. Additionally, previously infertile
    couples could still produce a child of their own
    as both their body cells are replicated to make
    an embryo. However, many people believe that
    cloning is morally wrong as it is ''disrupting
    nature's course''. They may also object for
    religious reasons.
11  It could be useful as it may help people         
5   survive.
11  It is possible to clone human body cells, and it 
6   may help to save lives as there will always be a
    matching donar, however people object as it is
    morally wrong as people think those who clone
    things are playing God.
11  It may be useful to produce human clones if a    
7   couple cannot conceive and have children
    naturally. Also if a person experienced an
    accident and lots of tissues are destroyed.
    Cloning some body cells can substitute the
    damaged cells. However, some people object to
    the idea because clones are likely to have
    genetic problems and diseases which sexual
    reproduction can help to avoid (such as
    variations in offspring) and cloning of humans
    are going against nature (and some people
    believe - God).
11  This is useful because it can help save lifes,   
8   by genetic engerneering we can make organs but
    some people object because its not natural and
    can cause problems. Some people have religious
    beliefs.
11  It could be useful because then we can discover  
9   more things about a clone, this could be useful
    in different reasons for example more research
    could be done. But other people would object
    this process because it could be dangerous, and
    people would make fun of this and think it is a
    joke.
12  It would be helpful to quore cancer and other    
0   life Featiting illness people mite object
    because Its something completely different, and
    it many not work.
12  Cloning cells means organs can be produced to    
1   help save lives. It means if someone needed a
    heart they would not have to wait long. However
    some people think this process is unnatural and
    interfers with life.
12  use full cause can get a rare type of blood to a 
2   dieing person who has the rare blood type.
    people object cause some things may lead to, to
    much cloneing of one person body part
12  People object as they feel it is not for humans  
3   to tamper with, it is unatural. It may be useful
    to scientists to = help prevent diseases,
    inherited ones. This is a way of eradicating
    certain diseases.
12  It is useful in that it gives us the ability to  
4   produce organs that can then be used in medicine
    to save people lives. There is, however, a great
    deal of controversy on this subject as many
    people feel it is unethical and wrong to clone
    humans as it could get out of hand and we would
    not know when to stop . Eventually it may
    emotionally harm the cloned humans.
12  Cloning humans would allow the creation of organ 
5   donors whose tissue type matched perfectly with
    the person in need of a transplant. However,
    cloning humans causes many ethical dilemmas,
    such as what the rights of a clone should be and
    whether it might be used to create a new class
    of people, so some people object to the cloning.
12  This is useful as it can be used for skin grafts 
6   when someone has had a disfiguring accident.
    Some people object to this process because it is
    'unnatural' and perceived as interfering with
    nature
12  If someone was not able to have a child, cloning 
7   could be useful as you could form a zygote from
    using the cells from a person. People may object
    though as this process is not natural and they
    may think it cruel.
12  This may be useful if someone has cancer and     
8   needs some cells that are identical. It means
    that they can survive
12  this would help those who had lost a limb, or    
9   that had muscle detereation as the cells would
    be able to grow a new into the place of the lost
    or damaged tissue.
13  Cloning human body cells can be used medically   
0   to regenerate a kidney, or grow a body part of
    someone's who was born without one, or is very
    ill. It will allow for the perfect replica, as
    opposed to a donor, which may cause
    complications. Some object to this process as it
    is playing with the hands of GOD, and some see
    it as immoral. It will allow for a lack of
    privacy as peoples DNA will be kept, which is
    personal information. Thats why many object.
13  it is useful for medical resson like if so one   
1   need a liver or another organ they can clone
    someone and us it organ. people object to this
    because not good for the clone they are mostly
    misused and some religous people will not like
    the fact it goes aganist them
13  Being able to clone human cells would mean that  
2   it would be possible to generate new body parts
    for people with defective organs or amputees.
    Some people object to this as they do not think
    it is natural and believe you should not be able
    to select body parts or possibly the genes of a
    person
13  This may be useful as replacement organs or body 
3   parts could be grown. Fewer donors would be
    needed as the organs would be manufactured
    rather than donated. However, objections to this
    would most probably centre around the
    contraversial issue of the possibility of
    cloning entire humans and where these processes
    could lead. It could be argued that free will
    and individuality would be threatened.
13  Useful because they wont die and just keep       
4   living. But people want to die and not be
    brought back to life.
13  because it will seem like the scientist are      
5   trying to play God with real life humans.
13  The cloning of human body cells would be useful  
6   if someone needs a transplant to save them,
    doctors can clone that person and use that organ
    they need. But if the person has a disease, then
    the clone would have disease and is a living
    person.
13  If anybody parts where lost Donners where        
7   needed.
13  Because a good thing from a human body cell can  
8   be cloned and produced again, however this is
    dangerous and the world could have lots of
    clones causing life to be very different.
13  it could be useful that way some one can live    
9   again but people could object because it is not
    really a natural way of reproducting.
14  If your child died and you found out why         
0   afterwards, then you can make another one and
    break the problem. People object because it is
    not for us to play God and go round creating
    babies when we want. they might use cloning for
    evil, like using them as soldiers in wars.
14  if you produce a human cell you can produce      
1   another body part eg a liver or lung. people may
    protest against this because it is playing 'god'
14  It may be useful because it could help us to     
2   form perfect humans without any birth defects
    but some people object because the believe it is
    wrong to misuse cells and go against nature.
14  It will be useful for people that are ill and    
3   need organ transplants as clones of their own
    organs will not be rejected by their bodies as
    foreign organs maybe. Some people think it is
    inhumane to grow embryos simply for spare body
    parts. people are worried about designer babies
    resulting in clones as the world would become
    artifically full of perfect babies
14  It can useful for those who may have lost a      
4   loved one and cannot bear not having them there.
    Some people object to cloning because they
    believe it is wrong and against the will of God.
14  This will be usefull because you can use them    
5   for body parts. But most people disagry because
    its wrong.
14  Cloning human body cells can be used to grow new 
6   organs for use in transplants. It would
    eliminate rejection of the organ because the
    organ would be genetically identical to the
    recipient's genes. However, some people believe
    this would lead to cloning of humans to produce
    embryos and they believe that it is immoral to
    'grow' humans solely to be used as organ donors
    for others.
14  A clone could be grown to donate organs to an    
7   ill human. Because the organs would be
    identical, there would be no problems of
    rejection. Some people think that it is wrong to
    intefere with nature and ' play God' and that a
    clone should not be created just for organs and
    then killed.
14  This may be useful, because clones can be        
8   produced of a healthy organ and transplanted
    into person with a damaged organ. Some people
    object to this, because they think that humans
    should not play the role of God and experiment
    with genetic engineering.
14  It can be useful as we can recreate an organ or  
9   specific skin tissue for those injured or
    disabled. Won't have to necessarily wait for a
    donor. However it is very difficult and often
    many mutations occur therefore people object. It
    is also a long and expensive process.
15  It may be useful if somebody was trying for a    
0   baby, but couldn't have one therefore they would
    have a test tube baby, but some people would
    rather have it done / processed the natural way!
15  This may be useful because if somebody has a     
1   genetic defect or problem, for example
    blindness, replacement organs can be 'grown'.
    Similarly, the replacement of kidneys, hearts
    and lost limbs will become possible. People
    object to this process because of the
    controversy surrounding cloning humans just for
    'spare' body parts. What's more, they object the
    disruption of nature and the idea of some people
    'playing God'.
15  This may be useful if a person is missing a      
2   limb, such as an arm, scientiests can 'grow'
    another one. Some people object to exact
    replicas / clones of a whole complete person as
    all individuality would be lost. They believe it
    is disrespectful.
15  It is useful to do further research on that      
3   bodies genetics, but if a whole clone is
    produced, there will be massive trouble and the
    clone may commit a crime, holding the parent
    responsible because their DNA is identical.
15  because it may help by producing someone after   
4   they are dead, yet other people beleive that it
    may cause Inherrited desease
15  This may be use full to prevent painful deaths   
5   illness or suffering such as cancer or
    parkinson's disease.
15  It is not fair on the child, they also might be  
6   deformed or not live as long as other people and
    it wouldn't be fair.
15  It could be useful in organ transplantation,     
7   because all of the tissues, cells and blood
    groups match, some people may object because
    they think its not fair for people to have an
    exact recplica of a person made.
15  It may be useful because, if a person dies, then 
8   a cell from that person can be used to produce
    another person. People object to this process
    because they don't want the cells to be taken
    from dead people to produce cloned people.
15  it would be use full, because if someone has a   
9   Probelem with their body they can be cloned and
    use the body part on the clone, some people
    object to this because it is unfair to the clone
16  Some people object because you have to take      
0   something from the bucardo and keep it.
16  People often object to these types of processes  
1   because they don't want samples taken from
    someone they have lost, however it maybe useful
    to maybe find out reasons why a certain person
    has died and be able to find a cure for others.
16  By producing clones of human body cells,         
2   possible diseases an illness' maybe overcome
    however this process may lead to full human
    cloning and designer babies which people do not
    agree with.
16  This can be useful for medical developments such 
3   as clone specific healthy cells to replace
    diseased or damaged cells, or clone insulin
    producing cells for human use. However this
    presents ethical dilemmas as to how moral it is
    to clone humans in part or in whole and whether
    this should only be done to help save others
    lives or to produce whole new beings.
16  It could stop desease and make people live       
4   longer. people protest because they say its
    wrong and unatural.
16  This could be useful because you could clone an  
5   intelligent person and keep cloning it so when
    the other people have died, there'd just be
    intelligent people for example. People also
    object because it is also taking away someones
    identity and it could also be dangerous as many
    risks are involved.
16  This can be useful to grow organs and body parts 
6   which are damaged on people so that they can be
    replaced. Some people object to this through
    ethical issues such as that it is not a natural
    process and it will develop a new race with a
    desire to be perfect in every way.
16  Clones are good in the sense that there is no    
7   chance of a disease being passed
16  People who need transplants would be able to get 
8   them more easily if organs/body cells could be
    made on demand. Some people object as they say
    it is interfering too much with evolution and
    with God.
16  to save lives, some people think that it's not   
9   right as this isn't what are bodies where
    designed for, cloning.
17  This could help the human race to survive        
0   however some people think it is morally wrong to
    have genetically identical humans as they feel
    we should have individuality.
17  Cloning may be advantageous to humans. The main  
1   use would be for transplants. If a person needed
    any organ transplant (eg. heart, liver) by
    cloning an exact replica of the original organ
    can be grown and the body will except this organ
    whereas in other cases it may reject an organ.
    However the risks in cloning are not yet known
    and if there was any problem caused by the
    cloning it could be passed down generations and
    remain undiscovered for generations. Cloning may
    also be considered unethical as it involves
    using an embryo which some consider as a life in
    its own right. By cloning, therefore, the embryo
    is being killed and a life taken away.
17  It may be useful to find ''matches'' for certain 
2   transplants for example; a bone marrow
    transplant. However some people object because
    some things (people & animals) should stay
    unique and cloning them is immoral and wrong.
17  You can produce designer babys and you can make  
3   perfect baby
17  because it could help couples that can't have    
4   kids have a kid. People object because they
    think its wrong to be messing with nature plus
    it just copying another person so you could end
    up with about 50 people who are excactly the
    same.
17  This may be useful because it means that tissues 
5   and organs can grown. These can greatly benefit
    people who have illnesses that require
    transplants. Cloning could also cause mutations,
    which is why some people may object to it.
    Cloning is also useful because it means that
    infertile couples can have children. Some people
    may, however object to cloning because it
    eradicates natural variation which could be
    dangerous in the future. Some people also object
    to cloning because they believe it to be
    unethical.
17  It may be useful to produce clones of human body 
6   cells because it would provide organs for organ
    transplants and childless couples could have
    children made from their own cells rather than
    relying on egg or sperm donors. However, some
    people object to this process because cloning
    greatly reduces life expectancy, and for
    religious people; cloning is viewed as playing
    the role of their god(s). Some people also feel
    not enough is yet known about cloning to
    actually clone humans.
17  Producing clones of human body cells may be      
7   useful because if somebody has a disease and can
    be cured by cloning someone if they have bone
    marrow which can be used to cure them. Some
    people would object to this because it is
    unnatural and does not allow evolution and less
    variation.
17  This can be useful as cloning human body cells   
8   can decrease the chances of mutations occuring
    and they can also be used for growth and repair
    in the body. Some people may disagree with this
    because this means creating two identical beings
    and so they should not be played around with.
17  This is useful because it a very important       
9   person in the world died then scientist's would
    be able to make a new person (clone).
18  This may be useful to couples who are infertile  
0   and wish to have children. Some people object
    because they feel it is taking away a person's
    individuality and that it is morally wrong and
    many say it is''Playing God''
18  The cloning of stem cells would allow scientists 
1   to produce human organs or other body parts for
    transplantation, reducing the risk of rejection,
    allowing rare blood and tissue types to be
    provided for and without being dependant on a
    donor. Some people believe that this process may
    lead to the cloning of human beings in their
    entirety, the ethical value of which is highly
    contested.
18  Cloning human body cells would mean that organs  
2   could be grown to provide more organs for
    transplants. People who could not have children
    could grow clones of themselves but some people
    feel this is interfering to much into nature /
    Gods laws.
18  If clones could be made of humans it would help  
3   in making organs for people needed organ
    transplants. This is because some peoples bodies
    reject organs they are given or have no organs
    donated and these people can die. If organs were
    made as clones it could save many lives. Some,
    however, believe that it is morally wrong to
    create life and then destroy it, we should not
    "play God".
18  Human body cells could possibly be used to grow  
4   organs or help infertile parents produce
    children. However in researching this process
    human embryos might have to be experimented on
    and this produces ethical dilemmas, especially
    if children grown from human body cells posess
    deformities because initially mistakes would be
    made
18  Producing clones could be useful as it could     
5   provide body parts for people who need them. As
    they are clones of themselves they will not be
    rejected. People object to this process as they
    think it is wrong to 'play god' and wrong to
    breed something to be killed.
18  This is the 'Designer Baby' situation some       
6   people object as they believe it is wrong to be
    able to choose your babies characteristics i.e.
    hair colour, eye colour, intelligents. However
    it could be useful, if a baby had a heart
    problem you could clone it and use the clones
    heart to cure the original baby.
18  It would be possible to clone organs which then  
7   could be used in organ transplants. This would
    be preferable to using donor organs as there
    will be a constant supply and there is less
    chance of the organ being rejected by someone if
    the DNA is shared. Thus transplants will be more
    succesful. This could also be useful if someone
    lost a limb. It may also help advance medicine.
    However many feel cloning is unethical. They are
    worried that it is not fair to use an organ
    simply to give life to someone else. Many people
    are worried that there will be no limit on how
    far we go, which could result in humans being
    completely cloned and this could lead to
    designer babies. Others are worried the
    technology could pass into the wrong hands and
    it would be hard to control who has power when,
    they object.
18  It may be useful if a type of person becomes     
8   extinct like an eskimo, or in rebuilding the
    body from an accindnt. People object because you
    can recreate the same person after they have
    died, and they believe that person is dead and
    shouldn't come 'back to life.'
18  It would be useful to produce clones of human    
9   body cells because the best characteristics
    could be selected and passed on. It would also
    enable scientists to eliminate the chances of
    the baby having or developing any serious
    conditions. Some people object to this because
    the variation in the world would decrease and
    they also do not like the fact that it is not a
    natural process
19  People who are unable to have children will be   
0   able to have them. they could be used if someone
    is medically ill and needs an organ. Although
    these may be seen as disposable and you are also
    playing God.
19  all over the world there are many people who are 
1   unable to have children. Cloning human cells
    could give those people the chance to have
    babies. It would also be useful in other areas
    of medizine - for example healthy organs could
    be grown which could be used in transplants
    eliminating the problem of organ-donorship. Some
    people object to it however, because they think
    that it is immoral - almost as if people were '
    playing god' and going against natural
    processes. Some people simply want more care to
    be taken with the issue because of unforseen
    problems with the procedure.
19  Producing clones of human cells is useful as the 
2   cells can be used to create tissue or organs for
    implantation without the risk of rejection.
    Also, the cells can be used to produce an embryo
    for a couple who have difficulty conceiving.
    Some people object to cloning because they feel
    humans do not have the right to re-create life
    or living things.
19  It would be useful to clone human cells to       
3   produce organs, such as the heart, which are
    often needed for transplants, and are in short
    supply.However, it is objected to because some
    people believe it would lead to the cloning of
    humans themselves,which may remove the sanctity
    of life and people would no longer be
    individuals if someone is made in their image.
    They believe it is unethical and could have
    damaging consequences
19  It is useful to clone people so that if theres   
4   something wrong with them they can do a clone
    and use a body part which is not working, some
    people see this as wrong because they will be
    tampering with the natural way of life and it
    would be killing someone at the same time.
19  It may be useful in fighting certain diseases,   
5   creating new organs for those who need them and
    creating children for those who can't have them.
    However it is against natural law and religion
    objects to it, because it would be ''playing
    God''.
19  clones can be used to produce embryos, from      
6   which the people needing transplant can take
    bone narrow or organs that they might need and
    as its genes are genetically identical, there
    will be no problem with the body rejecting the
    transplant. Though many countries allow
    abortion, they believe that creating a 'life'
    just to kill it is ethically wrong' there are
    huge debates about the ethics of cloning and the
    unwanted results it can have, like premature
    aging and arthritus
19  People who have diseases, who are ill or need    
7   organ transplants will find it beneficiary for
    clones to be made because the cloned individual
    will have the same blood type etc. as them and
    because it is genetically identical,
    transplanted organs will not be rejected by the
    body. This process may be objected to because
    the clone is an individual in its own right and
    it may be seen as unfair to produce it simply to
    allow another individual to live.
19  It is useful for making (cloning human insulin)  
8   things like insulin, to give to those with
    insulin deficiencies. Therefore it can save
    lives. However some people object because they
    feel that individuality is lost and God would
    have made two identical people if he wanted
    them. Cloning may be useful to those people who
    cannot have children (due to infertility).
    Instead they could clone themselves.
19  This may be useful for transplanting organs,  -  
9   people's bodies would be more likely to accept
    organs cloned from their own body. However some
    people think it is morally wrong as it would be
    creating a life and then killing it for our own
    selfish purposes - (ie. playing god).
20  Human body cells are useful to be cloned as      
0   people will illnesses because they are missing
    cells (like bone marrow) can be cloned to
    produce new cells that won't be rejected by the
    body. However, people say this is wrong as
    humans should not play God or make an embryo
    just to kill it again
