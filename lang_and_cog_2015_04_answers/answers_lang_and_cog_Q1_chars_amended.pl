/* 
This file contains all the student answers for:
Language and Cognition, April 2015, Question 1.

I have replaced slanted double quotes with straight single quotes, because the system was not able to process them.
Ditto replaced single quotes with straight single quotes.
Ditto replaced endash 'â€“' with hyphen '-'.
I have added in revised versions of some questions in which a term that the system cannot analyse has been swapped out ('test', 'show','measure').
System can't analyse 'assessing', 'lateralization', or the parts in parenthesis in this example:
[ 42 , 2 ,"Assessing lateralization (of especially language) by temporarily inactivating one hemisphere."]
But succeeds for a revised version:
[ 1042 , 2 ,"Assess lateralisation of especially language by temporarily inactivating one hemisphere."]
xxxx How does the system manage parenthesis generally? Do they need to be represented in the rule patterns?
